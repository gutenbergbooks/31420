<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[v]</a></span></h2>


<p class="noind"><span class="smcap">In</span> this translation of a work rich in the raciest
beauties and defects of an author long since made known
to the British public, the present writer has striven to
recast the trenchant humour, the scornful eloquence,
the epigrammatic dash of Mr. Michelet, in language
not all unworthy of such a word-master. How far he
has succeeded others may be left to judge. In one
point only is he aware of having been less true to his
original than in theory he was bound to be. He has
slurred or slightly altered a few of those passages
which French readers take as a thing of course, but
English ones, because of their different training, are
supposed to eschew. A Frenchman, in short, writes
for men, an Englishman rather for drawing-room
ladies, who tolerate grossness only in the theatres and
the columns of the newspapers. Mr. Michelet&#8217;s subject,
and his late researches, lead him into details, moral and
physical, which among ourselves are seldom mixed up
with themes of general talk. The coarsest of these
have been pruned away, but enough perhaps remain
to startle readers of especial prudery. The translator,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
however, felt that he had no choice between shocking
these and sinning against his original. Readers of a
larger culture will make allowance for such a strait,
will not be so very frightened at an amount of plain-speaking,
neither in itself immoral, nor, on the whole,
impertinent. Had he docked his work of everything
condemned by prudish theories, he might have made
it more conventionally decent; but Michelet would
have been puzzled to recognize himself in the poor
maimed cripple that would then have borne his name.</p>

<p>Nor will a reader of average shrewdness mistake the
religious drift of a book suppressed by the Imperial
underlings in the interests neither of religion nor of
morals, but merely of Popery in its most outrageous
form. If its attacks on Rome seem, now and then, to
involve Christianity itself, we must allow something
for excess of warmth, and something for the nature of
inquiries which laid bare the rotten outgrowths of a
religion in itself the purest known among men. In
studying the so-called Ages of Faith, the author has
only found them worthy of their truer and older title,
the Ages of Darkness. It is against the tyranny,
feudal and priestly, of those days, that he raises an
outcry, warranted almost always by facts which a more
mawkish philosophy refuses to see. If he is sometimes
hasty and onesided; if the Church and the Feudal
System of those days had their uses for the time being;
it is still a gain to have the other side of the subject<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>
kept before us by way of counterpoise to the doctrines
now in vogue. We need not be intolerant; but Rome
is yet alive.</p>

<p>Taken as a whole, Mr. Michelet&#8217;s book cannot be
called unchristian. Like most thoughtful minds of
the day, he yearns for some nobler and larger creed
than that of the theologians; for a creed which, understanding
Nature, shall reconcile it with Nature&#8217;s God.
Nor may he fairly be called irreverent for talking,
Frenchman like, of things spiritual with the same
freedom as he would of things temporal. Perhaps in
his heart of hearts he has nearly as much religious
earnestness as they who call Dr. Colenso an infidel,
and shake their heads at the doubtful theology of
Frederic Robertson. At any rate, no translator who
should cut or file away so special a feature of French
feeling would be doing justice to so marked an
original.</p>

<p>For English readers who already know the concise
and sober volumes of their countryman, Mr. Wright,
the present work will offer mainly an interesting study
of the author himself. It is a curious compound of
rhapsody and sound reason, of history and romance, of
coarse realism and touching poetry, such as, even in
France, few save Mr. Michelet could have produced.
Founded on truth and close inquiry, it still reads more
like a poem than a sober history. As a beautiful
speculation, which has nearly, but not quite, grasped<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
the physical causes underlying the whole history of
magic and illusion in all ages, it may be read with
profit as well as pleasure in this age of vulgar spirit-rapping.
But the true history of Witchcraft has yet
to be written by some cooler hand.</p>

<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION"></a>INTRODUCTION.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1" id="Page_1">[1]</a></span></h2>


<p class="noind"><span class="smcap">It</span> was said by Sprenger, before the year 1500,
&#8220;<i>Heresy of witches</i>, not of wizards, must we call it,
for these latter are of very small account.&#8221; And by
another, in the time of Louis XIII.: &#8220;To one wizard,
ten thousand witches.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Witches they are by nature.&#8221; It is a gift peculiar
to woman and her temperament. By birth a
fay, by the regular recurrence of her ecstasy she
becomes a sibyl. By her love she grows into an
enchantress. By her subtlety, by a roguishness often
whimsical and beneficent, she becomes a Witch; she
works her spells; does at any rate lull our pains to
rest and beguile them.</p>

<p>All primitive races have the same beginning, as so
many books of travel have shown. While the man is
hunting and fighting, the woman works with her wits,
with her imagination: she brings forth dreams and
gods. On certain days she becomes a seeress, borne
on boundless wings of reverie and desire. The better
to reckon up the seasons, she watches the sky; but
her heart belongs to earth none the less. Young and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
flower-like herself, she looks down toward the enamoured
flowers, and forms with them a personal acquaintance.
As a woman, she beseeches them to heal
the objects of her love.</p>

<p>In a way so simple and touching do all religion and
all science begin. Ere long everything will get parcelled
out; we shall mark the beginning of the professional
man as juggler, astrologer, or prophet, necromancer,
priest, physician. But at first the woman
is everything.</p>

<p>A religion so strong and hearty as that of Pagan
Greece begins with the Sibyl to end in the Witch. The
former, a lovely maiden in the broad daylight, rocked
its cradle, endowed it with a charm and glory of its
own. Presently it fell sick, lost itself in the darkness
of the Middle Ages, and was hidden away by the Witch
in woods and wilds: there, sustained by her compassionate
daring, it was made to live anew. Thus, of
every religion woman is the mother, the gentle guardian,
the faithful nurse. With her the gods fare like
men: they are born and die upon her bosom.</p>

<hr />

<p>Alas! her loyalty costs her dear. Ye magian queens
of Persia; bewitching Circe; sublime Sibyl! Into
what have ye grown, and how cruel the change that
has come upon you! She who from her throne in the
East taught men the virtues of plants and the courses
of the stars; who, on her Delphic tripod beamed over
with the god of light, as she gave forth her oracle to a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
world upon its knees;&mdash;she also it is whom, a thousand
years later, people hunt down like a wild beast; following
her into the public places, where she is dishonoured,
worried, stoned, or set upon the burning
coals!</p>

<p>For this poor wretch the priesthood can never have
done with their faggots, nor the people with their
insults, nor the children with their stones. The poet,
childlike, flings her one more stone, for a woman the
cruellest of all. On no grounds whatever, he imagines
her to have been always old and ugly. The word
&#8220;witch&#8221; brings before us the frightful old women of
<i>Macbeth</i>. But their cruel processes teach us the
reverse of that. Numbers perished precisely for being
young and beautiful.</p>

<p>The Sibyl foretold a fortune, the Witch accomplishes
one. Here is the great, the true difference between
them. The latter calls forth a destiny, conjures it,
works it out. Unlike the Cassandra of old, who
awaited mournfully the future she foresaw so well, this
woman herself creates the future. Even more than
Circe, than Medea, does she bear in her hand the rod
of natural miracle, with Nature herself as sister and
helpmate. Already she wears the features of a modern
Prometheus. With her industry begins, especially
that queen-like industry which heals and restores
mankind. As the Sibyl seemed to gaze upon the
morning, so she, contrariwise, looks towards the west;
but it is just that gloomy west, which long before<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
dawn&mdash;as happens among the tops of the Alps&mdash;gives
forth a flush anticipant of day.</p>

<p>Well does the priest discern the danger, the bane,
the alarming rivalry, involved in this priestess of nature
whom he makes a show of despising. From the
gods of yore she has conceived other gods. Close to
the Satan of the Past we see dawning within her a
Satan of the Future.</p>

<hr />

<p>The only physician of the people for a thousand
years was the Witch. The emperors, kings, popes,
and richer barons had indeed their doctors of Salerno,
their Moors and Jews; but the bulk of people in every
state, the world as it might well be called, consulted
none but the <i>Saga</i>, or wise-woman. When she could
not cure them, she was insulted, was called a Witch.
But generally, from a respect not unmixed with fear,
she was called good lady or fair lady (<i>belle dame</i>&mdash;<i>bella
donna</i><a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>), the very name we give to the fairies.</p>

<p>Soon there came upon her the lot which still befalls
her favourite plant, belladonna, and some other wholesome
poisons which she employed as antidotes to the
great plagues of the Middle Ages. Children and
ignorant passers-by would curse those dismal flowers
before they knew them. Affrighted by their questionable
hues, they shrink back, keep far aloof from
them. And yet among them are the <i>comforters</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>(Solane&aelig;) which, when discreetly employed, have cured
so many, have lulled so many sufferings to sleep.</p>

<p>You find them in ill-looking spots, growing all
lonely and ill-famed amidst ruins and rubbish-heaps.
Therein lies one other point of resemblance between
these flowers and her who makes use of them. For
where else than in waste wildernesses could live the poor
wretch whom all men thus evilly entreated; the woman
accursed and proscribed as a poisoner, even while she
used to heal and save; as the betrothed of the Devil
and of evil incarnate, for all the good which, according
to the great physician of the Renaissance, she herself
had done? When Paracelsus, at Basle, in 1527,
threw all medicine into the fire,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> he avowed that he
knew nothing but what he had learnt from witches.</p>

<p>This was worth a requital, and they got it. They
were repaid with tortures, with the stake. For them
new punishments, new pangs, were expressly devised.
They were tried in a lump; they were condemned by
a single word. Never had there been such wastefulness
of human life. Not to speak of Spain, that classic
land of the faggot, where Moor and Jew are always
accompanied by the Witch, there were burnt at Tr&egrave;ves
seven thousand, and I know not how many at Toulouse;
five hundred at Geneva in three months of
1513; at Wurtzburg eight hundred, almost in one
batch, and fifteen hundred at Bamberg; these two
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>latter being very small bishoprics! Even Ferdinand
II., the savage Emperor of the Thirty Years&#8217; War, was
driven, bigot as he was, to keep a watch on these worthy
bishops, else they would have burned all their subjects.
In the Wurtzburg list I find one Wizard a schoolboy,
eleven years old; a Witch of fifteen: and at Bayonne
two, infernally beautiful, of seventeen years.</p>

<p>Mark how, at certain seasons, hatred wields this one
word <i>Witch</i>, as a means of murdering whom she will.
Woman&#8217;s jealousy, man&#8217;s greed, take ready hold of so
handy a weapon. Is such a one wealthy? <i>She is a
Witch.</i> Is that girl pretty? <i>She is a Witch.</i> You
will even see the little beggar-woman, La Murgui,
leave a death-mark with that fearful stone on the
forehead of a great lady, the too beautiful dame of
Lancinena.</p>

<p>The accused, when they can, avert the torture by
killing themselves. Remy, that excellent judge of
Lorraine, who burned some eight hundred of them,
crows over this very fear. &#8220;So well,&#8221; said he, &#8220;does
my way of justice answer, that of those who were arrested
the other day, sixteen, without further waiting,
strangled themselves forthwith.&#8221;</p>

<hr />

<p>Over the long track of my History, during the
thirty years which I have devoted to it, this frightful
literature of witchcraft passed to and fro repeatedly
through my hands. First I exhausted the manuals of
the Inquisition, the asinine foolings of the Dominicans.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
(<i>Scourges</i>, <i>Hammers</i>, <i>Ant-hills</i>, <i>Floggings</i>, <i>Lanterns</i>,
&amp;c., are the titles of their books.) Next, I read the
Parliamentarists, the lay judges who despised the
monks they succeeded, but were every whit as foolish
themselves. One word further would I say of them
here: namely, this single remark, that, from 1300 to
1600, and yet later, but one kind of justice may be
seen. Barring a small interlude in the Parliament of
Paris, the same stupid savagery prevails everywhere,
at all hours. Even great parts are of no use here.
As soon as witchcraft comes into question, the fine-natured
De Lancre, a Bordeaux magistrate and forward
politician under Henry IV., sinks back to the level of
a Nider, a Sprenger; of the monkish ninnies of the
fifteenth century.</p>

<p>It fills one with amazement to see these different
ages, these men of diverse culture, fail in taking the
least step forward. Soon, however, you begin clearly
to understand how all were checked alike, or let us
rather say blinded, made hopelessly drunk and savage,
by the poison of their guiding principle. That principle
lies in the statement of a radical injustice: &#8220;On
account of one man all are lost; are not only punished
but worthy of punishment; <i>depraved and perverted
beforehand</i>, dead to God even before their birth. The
very babe at the breast is damned.&#8221;</p>

<p>Who says so? Everyone, even Bossuet himself. A
leading doctor in Rome, Spina, a Master of the Holy
Palace, formulates the question neatly: &#8220;Why does God<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
suffer the innocent to die?&mdash;For very good reasons:
even if they do not die on account of their own sins,
they are always liable to death as guilty of the original
sin.&#8221; (<i>De Strigibus</i>, ch. 9.)</p>

<p>From this atrocity spring two results, the one pertaining
to justice, the other to logic. The judge is
never at fault in his work: the person brought before
him is certainly guilty, the more so if he makes a
defence. Justice need never beat her head, or work
herself into a heat, in order to distinguish the truth
from the falsehood. Everyhow she starts from a foregone
conclusion. Again, the logician, the schoolman,
has only to analyse the soul, to take count of the
shades it passes through, of its manifold nature, its
inward strifes and battles. He had no need, as we
have, to explain how that soul may grow wicked step
by step. At all such niceties and groping efforts, how,
if even he could understand them, would he laugh and
wag his head! And, oh! how gracefully then would
quiver those splendid ears which deck his empty skull!</p>

<p>Especially in treating of the <i>compact with the Devil</i>,
that awful covenant whereby, for the poor profit of one
day, the spirit sells itself to everlasting torture, we of
another school would seek to trace anew that road
accursed, that frightful staircase of mishaps and crimes,
which had brought it to a depth so low. Much, however,
cares our fine fellow for all that! To him soul
and Devil seem born for each other, insomuch that on
the first temptation, for a whim, a desire, a passing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
fancy, the soul will throw itself at one stroke into so
horrible an extremity.</p>

<hr />

<p>Neither do I find that the moderns have made much
inquiry into the moral chronology of witchcraft. They
cling too much to the connection between antiquity and
the Middle Ages; connection real indeed, but slight, of
small importance. Neither from the magician of old,
nor the seeress of Celts and Germans, comes forth the
true Witch. The harmless &#8220;Sabasies&#8221; (from Bacchus
Sabasius), and the petty rural &#8220;Sabbath&#8221; of the
Middle Ages, have nothing to do with the Black Mass
of the fourteenth century, with the grand defiance
then solemnly given to Jesus. This fearful conception
never grew out of a long chain of tradition. It leapt
forth from the horrors of the day.</p>

<p>At what date, then, did the Witch first appear? I
say unfalteringly, &#8220;In the age of despair:&#8221; of that
deep despair which the gentry of the Church engendered.
Unfalteringly do I say, &#8220;The Witch is a crime
of their own achieving.&#8221;</p>

<p>I am not to be taken up short by the excuses which
their sugary explanations seem to furnish. &#8220;Weak
was that creature, and giddy, and pliable under temptation.
She was drawn towards evil by her lust.&#8221;
Alas! in the wretchedness, the hunger of those days,
nothing of that kind could have ruffled her even into
a hellish rage. An amorous woman, jealous and forsaken,
a child hunted out by her step-mother, a mother<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
beaten by her son (old subjects these of story), if
such as they were ever tempted to call upon the Evil
Spirit, yet all this would make no Witch. These poor
creatures may have called on Satan, but it does not
follow that he accepted them. They are still far, ay,
very far from being ripe for him. They have not yet
learned to hate God.</p>

<hr />

<p>For the better understanding of this point, you
should read those hateful registers which remain to us
of the Inquisition, not only in the extracts given by
Llorente, by Lamothe-Langon, &amp;c., but in what remains
of the original registers of Toulouse. Read
them in all their flatness, in all their dryness, so dismal,
so terribly savage. At the end of a few pages
you feel yourself stricken with a chill; a cruel shiver
fastens upon you; death, death, death, is traceable in
every line. Already you are in a bier, or else in a stone
cell with mouldy walls. Happiest of all are the killed.
The horror of horrors is the <i>In pace</i>. This phrase it
is which comes back unceasingly, like an ill-omened
bell sounding again and again the heart&#8217;s ruin of the
living dead: always we have the same word, &#8220;Immured.&#8221;</p>

<p>Frightful machinery for crushing and flattening;
most cruel press for shattering the soul! One turn of
the screw follows another, until, all breathless, and
with a loud crack, it has burst forth from the machine
and fallen into the unknown world.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>On her first appearance the Witch has neither father
nor mother, nor son, nor husband, nor family. She is
a marvel, an aerolith, alighted no one knows whence.
Who, in Heaven&#8217;s name, would dare to draw near her?</p>

<p>Her place of abode? It is in spots impracticable,
in a forest of brambles, on a wild moor where thorn
and thistle intertwining forbid approach. The night
she passes under an old cromlech. If anyone finds her
there, she is isolated by the common dread; she is
surrounded, as it were, by a ring of fire.</p>

<p>And yet&mdash;would you believe it?&mdash;she is a woman
still. This very life of hers, dreadful though it be,
tightens and braces her woman&#8217;s energy, her womanly
electricity. Hence, you may see her endowed with two
gifts. One is the <i>inspiration of lucid frenzy</i>, which
in its several degrees, becomes poesy, second-sight,
depth of insight, cunning simplicity of speech, the
power especially of believing in yourself through all
your delusions. Of such a gift the man, the wizard,
knows nothing. On his side no beginning would have
been made.</p>

<p>From this gift flows that other, the sublime power
of <i>unaided conception</i>, that parthenogenesis which our
physiologists have come to recognise, as touching fruitfulness
of the body in the females of several species;
and which is not less a truth with regard to the conceptions
of the spirit.</p>

<hr />

<p>By herself did she conceive and bring forth&mdash;what?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
A second self, who resembles her in his self-delusions.
The son of her hatred, conceived upon her love; for
without love can nothing be created. For all the alarm
this child gave her, she has become so well again, is
so happily engrossed with this new idol, that she
places it straightway upon her altar, to worship it,
yield her life up to it, and offer herself up as a living
and perfect sacrifice. Very often she will even say to
her judge, &#8220;There is but one thing I fear; that I
shall not suffer enough for him.&#8221;&mdash;(<i>Lancre.</i>)</p>

<p>Shall I tell you what the child&#8217;s first effort was? It
was a fearful burst of laughter. Has he not cause for
mirth on his broad prairie, far away from the Spanish
dungeons and the &#8220;immured&#8221; of Toulouse? The
whole world is his <i>In pace</i>. He comes, and goes, and
walks to and fro. His is the boundless forest, his the
desert with its far horizons, his the whole earth, in the
fulness of its teeming girdle. The Witch in her tenderness
calls him &#8220;<i>Robin mine</i>,&#8221; the name of that
bold outlaw, the joyous Robin Hood, who lived under
the green bowers. She delights too in calling him
fondly by such names as <i>Little Green</i>, <i>Pretty-Wood</i>,
<i>Greenwood</i>; after the little madcap&#8217;s favourite haunts.
He had hardly seen a thicket when he took to playing
the truant.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<hr />

<p>What astounds one most is, that at one stroke the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>Witch should have achieved an actual Being. He
bears about him every token of reality. We have
heard and seen him; anyone could draw his likeness.</p>

<p>The Saints, those darling sons of the house, with
their dreams and meditations make but little stir;
<i>they look forward waitingly</i>, as men assured of their
part in Elysium. What little energy they have is all
centred in the narrow round of <i>Imitation</i>; a word
which condenses the whole of the Middle Ages. He
on the other hand&mdash;this accursed bastard whose only lot
is the scourge&mdash;has no idea of waiting. He is always
seeking and will never rest. He busies himself with
all things between earth and heaven. He is exceedingly
curious; will dig, dive, ferret, and poke his nose
everywhere. At the <i>consummatum est</i> he only laughs,
the little scoffer! He is always saying &#8220;Further,&#8221; or
&#8220;Forward.&#8221; Moreover, he is not hard to please. He
takes every rebuff; picks up every windfall. For instance,
when the Church throws out nature as impure
and doubtworthy, Satan fastens on her for his own
adornment. Nay, more; he employs her, and makes
her useful to him as the fountain-head of the arts;
thus accepting the awful name with which others
would brand him; to wit, the <i>Prince of the World</i>.</p>

<p>Some one rashly said, &#8220;Woe to those who laugh.&#8221;
Thus from the first was Satan intrusted with too pretty
a part; he had the sole right of laughing, and of declaring
it an <i>amusement</i>&mdash;rather let us say <i>a necessity</i>;
for laughing is essentially a natural function. Life<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
would be unbearable if we could not laugh, at least in
our afflictions.</p>

<p>Looking on life as nothing but a trial, the Church
is careful not to prolong it. Her medicine is resignation,
the looking for and the hope of death. A broad field
this for Satan! He becomes the physician, the healer
of the living. Better still, he acts as comforter: he is
good enough to shew us our dead, to call up the shades
of our beloved.</p>

<p>One more trifle the Church rejected, namely, logic
or free reason. Here was a special dainty, to which
<i>the other</i> greedily helped himself. The Church had
carefully builded up a small <i>In pace</i>, narrow, low-roofed,
lighted by one dim opening, a mere cranny.
That was called <i>The School</i>. Into it were turned
loose a few shavelings, with this commandment, &#8220;Be
free.&#8221; They all fell lame. In three or four centuries
the paralysis was confirmed, and Ockham&#8217;s standpoint
is the very same as Ab&eacute;lard&#8217;s.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>It is pleasant to track the Renaissance up to such a
point. The Renaissance took place indeed, but how?
Through the Satanic daring of those who pierced the
vault, through the efforts of the damned who were
bent on seeing the sky. And it took place yet more
largely away from the schools and the men of letters,
in the <i>School of the Bush</i>, where Satan had set up a
class for the Witch and the shepherd.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>
<p>Perilous teaching it was, if so it happened; but the
very dangers of it heightened the eager passion, the
uncontrollable yearning to see and to know. Thus
began those wicked sciences, physic debarred from
poisoning, and that odious anatomy. There, along
with his survey of the heavens, the shepherd who kept
watch upon the stars applied also his shameful nostrums,
made his essays upon the bodies of animals.
The Witch would bring out a corpse stolen from the
neighbouring cemetery; and, for the first time, at risk
of being burned, you might gaze upon that heavenly
wonder, &#8220;which men&#8221;&mdash;as M. Serres has well said&mdash;&#8220;are
foolish enough to bury, instead of trying to
understand.&#8221;</p>

<p>Paracelsus, the only doctor whom Satan admitted
there, saw yet a third worker, who, stealing at times
into that dark assembly, displayed there his surgical
art. This was the surgeon of those happy days, the
headsman stout of hand, who could play patly enough
with the fire, could break bones and set them again;
who if he killed, would sometimes save, by hanging
one only for a certain time.</p>

<p>By the more sacrilegious of its essays this convict
university of witches, shepherds, and headsmen, emboldened
the other, obliged its rival to study. For
everyone wanted to live. The Witch would have got hold
of everything: people would for ever have turned their
backs on the doctor. And so the Church was fain to
suffer, to countenance these crimes. She avowed he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>r
belief in <i>good poisons</i> (Grillandus). She found herself
driven and constrained to allow of public dissections.
In 1306 one woman, in 1315 another, was opened and
dissected by the Italian Mondino. Here was a holy
revelation, the discovery of a greater world than that
of Christopher Columbus! Fools shuddered or howled;
but wise men fell upon their knees.</p>

<hr />

<p>With such conquests the Devil was like enough to
live on. Never could the Church alone have put an
end to him. The stake itself was useless, save for
some political objects.</p>

<p>Men had presently the wit to cleave Satan&#8217;s realm
in twain. Against the Witch, his daughter, his bride,
they armed his son, the doctor. Heartily, utterly as
the Church loathed the latter, yet to extinguish the
Witch, she established his monopoly nevertheless. In
the fourteenth century she proclaimed, that any woman
who dared to heal others <i>without having duly studied</i>,
was a witch and should therefore die.</p>

<p>But how was she to study in public? Fancy what
a scene of mingled fun and horror would have occurred,
if the poor savage had risked an entrance into
the schools! What games and merry-makings there
would have been! On Midsummer Day they used to
chain cats together and burn them in the fire. But to
tie up a Witch in that hell of caterwaulers, a Witch
yelling and roasting, what fun it would have been for
that precious crew of monklings and cowlbearers!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>In due time we shall see the decline of Satan. Sad
to tell, we shall find him pacified, turned into <i>a good
old fellow</i>. He will be robbed and plundered, until of
the two masks he wore at the Sabbath, the dirtiest is
taken by Tartuffe. His spirit is still everywhere, but
of his bodily self, in losing the Witch he lost all. The
wizards were only wearisome.</p>

<p>Now that we have hurled him so far downwards,
are we fully aware of what has happened? Was he
not an important actor, an essential item in the great
religious machine just now slightly out of gear? All
organisms that work properly are twofold, twosided.
Life can otherwise not go on at all. It is a kind of
balance between two forces, opposite, symmetrical,
but unequal; the lower answering to the other as its
counterpoise. The higher chafes at it, seeks to put it
down. So doing, it is all wrong.</p>

<p>When Colbert, in 1672, got rid of Satan, with very
little ceremony, by forbidding the judges to entertain
pleas of witchcraft, the sturdy Parliament of Normandy
with its sound Norman logic pointed out the dangerous
drift of such a decision. The Devil is nothing less
than a dogma holding on to all the rest. If you
meddle with the Eternally Conquered, are you not
meddling with the Conqueror likewise? To doubt the
acts of the former, leads to doubting the acts of the
second, the miracles he wrought for the very purpose
of withstanding the Devil. The pillars of heaven are
grounded in the Abyss. He who thoughtlessly removes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
that base infernal, may chance to split up Paradise
itself.</p>

<p>Colbert could not listen, having other business to
mind. But the Devil perhaps gave heed and was
comforted. Amidst such minor means of earning a
livelihood as spirit-rapping or table-turning, he grows
resigned, and believes at least that he will not die
alone.</p>

<h3>THE DEATH OF THE GODS.</h3>


<p class="noind"><span class="smcap">Certain</span> authors have declared that, shortly before
the triumph of Christianity, a voice mysterious ran
along the shores of the &AElig;gean Sea, crying, &#8220;Great
Pan is dead!&#8221; The old universal god of nature was
no more; and great was the joy thereat. Men fancied
that with the death of nature temptation itself was
dead. After the troublings of so long a storm, the
soul of man was at length to find rest.</p>

<p>Was it merely a question touching the end of that
old worship, its overthrow, and the eclipse of old
religious rites? By no means. Consult the earliest
Christian records, and in every line you may read the
hope, that nature is about to vanish, life to be extinguished;
that the end of the world, in short, is very
near. It is all over with the gods of life, who have
spun out its mockeries to such a length. Everything<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
is falling, breaking up, rushing down headlong.
The whole is becoming as nought: &#8220;Great Pan is
dead!&#8221;</p>

<p>It was nothing new that the gods must perish.
Many an ancient worship was grounded in that very
idea. Osiris, Adonis die indeed in order to rise again.
On the stage itself, in plays which were only acted
for the feast days of the gods, &AElig;schylus expressly
averred by the mouth of Prometheus, that some day
they should suffer death: but how? As conquered
and laid low by the Titans, the ancient powers of
nature.</p>

<p>Here, however, things are quite otherwise. Alike
in generals and particulars, in the past and the future,
would the early Christians have cursed Nature herself.
So utterly did they condemn her, as to find the Devil
incarnate in a flower. Swiftly may the angels come
again, who erst overwhelmed the cities of the Dead
Sea! Oh, that they may sweep off, may crumple up as
a veil the hollow frame of this world; may at length
deliver the saints from their long trial!</p>

<p>The Evangelist said, &#8220;The day is coming:&#8221; the
Fathers, &#8220;It is coming immediately.&#8221; From the
breaking-up of the Empire and the invasion of the
Barbarians, St. Augustin draws the hope that very
soon no city would remain but the city of God.</p>

<p>And yet, how hard of dying is the world; how
stubbornly bent on living! Like Hezekiah, it begs
a respite, one turn more of the dial. Well, then, be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
it so until the year one thousand. But thereafter,
not one day.</p>

<hr />

<p>Are we quite sure of what has been so often
repeated, that the gods of old had come to an end,
themselves wearied and sickened of living; that they
were so disheartened as almost to send in their resignation;
that Christianity had only to blow upon these
empty shades?</p>

<p>They point to the gods in Rome; they point out
those in the Capitol, admitted there only by a kind of
preliminary death, on the surrender, I might say, of
all their local pith; as having disowned their country,
as having ceased to be the representative spirits of the
nations. In order to receive them, indeed, Rome had
performed on them a cruel operation: they were
enervated, bleached. Those great centralized deities
became in their official life the mournful functionaries
of the Roman Empire. But the decline of that
Olympian aristocracy had in no wise drawn down
the host of home-born gods, the mob of deities still
keeping hold of the boundless country-sides, of the
woods, the hills, the fountains; still intimately blended
with the life of the country. These gods abiding in
the heart of oaks, in waters deep and rushing, could
not be driven therefrom.</p>

<p>Who says so? The Church. She rudely gainsays
her own words. Having proclaimed their death, she
is indignant because they live. Time after time, by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
the threatening voice of her councils<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> she gives
them notice of their death&mdash;and lo! they are living still.</p>

<p>&#8220;They are devils.&#8221;&mdash;Then they must be alive.
Failing to make an end of them, men suffer the
simple folk to clothe, to disguise them. By the help
of legends they come to be baptized, even to be foisted
upon the Church. But at least they are converted?
Not yet. We catch them stealthily subsisting in their
own heathen character.</p>

<p>Where are they? In the desert, on the moor, in
the forest? Ay; but, above all, in the house. They are
kept up by the most intimate household usages. The
wife guards and hides them in her household things,
even in her bed. With her they have the best place
in the world, better than the temple,&mdash;the fireside.</p>

<hr />

<p>Never was revolution so violent as that of Theodosius.
Antiquity shows no trace of such proscription
of any worship. The Persian fire-worshipper might,
in the purity of his heroism, have insulted the visible
deities, but he let them stand nevertheless. He
greatly favoured the Jews, protecting and employing
them. Greece, daughter of the light, made merry
with the gods of darkness, the tunbellied Cabiri; but
yet she bore with them, adopted them as workmen,
even to shaping out of them her own Vulcan. Rome
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>in her majesty welcomed not only Etruria, but even
the rural gods of the old Italian labourer. She persecuted
the Druids, but only as the centre of a dangerous
national resistance.</p>

<p>Christianity conquering sought and thought to slay
the foe. It demolished the schools, by proscribing
logic and uprooting the philosophers, whom Valens
slaughtered. It razed or emptied the temples, shivered
to pieces the symbols. The new legend would have
been propitious to the family, had the father not been
cancelled in Saint Joseph; had the mother been set
up as an educatress, as having morally brought forth
Jesus. A fruitful road there was, but abandoned at
the very outset through the effort to attain a high but
barren purity.</p>

<p>So Christianity turned into that lonely path where
the world was going of itself; the path of a celibacy
in vain opposed by the laws of the emperors. Down
this slope it was hurled headlong by the establishment
of monkery.</p>

<p>But in the desert was man alone? The Devil kept
him company with all manner of temptations. He
could not help himself, he was driven to create anew
societies, nay whole cities of anchorites. We all know
those dismal towns of monks which grew up in the
Thebaid; how wild, unruly a spirit dwelt among them;
how deadly were their descents on Alexandria. They
talked of being troubled, beset by the Devil; and they
told no lie.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>A huge gap was made in the world; and who was
to fill it? The Christians said, The Devil, everywhere
the Devil: <i>ubique d&aelig;mon</i>.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>Greece, like all other nations, had her <i>energumens</i>,
who were sore tried, possessed by spirits. The relation
there is quite external; the seeming likeness is
really none at all. Here we have no spirits of any
kind: they are but black children of the Abyss, the
ideal of waywardness. Thenceforth we see them
everywhere, those poor melancholics, loathing, shuddering
at their own selves. Think what it must be to
fancy yourself double, to believe in that <i>other</i>, that
cruel host who goes and comes and wanders within
you, making you roam at his pleasure among deserts,
over precipices! You waste and weaken more and
more; and the weaker grows your wretched body, the
more is it worried by the devil. In woman especially
these tyrants dwell, making her blown and swollen.
They fill her with an infernal <i>wind</i>, they brew in her
storms and tempests, play with her as the whim seizes
them, drive her to wickedness, to despair.</p>

<p>And not ourselves only, but all nature, alas! becomes
demoniac. If there is a devil in the flower, how
much more in the gloomy forest! The light we think
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>so pure teems with children of the night. The
heavens themselves&mdash;O blasphemy!&mdash;are full of hell.
That divine morning star, whose glorious beams not
seldom lightened a Socrates, an Archimedes, a Plato,
what is it now become? A devil, the archfiend
Lucifer. In the eventime again it is the devil Venus
who draws me into temptation by her light so soft and
mild.</p>

<p>That such a society should wax wroth and terrible
is not surprising. Indignant at feeling itself so weak
against devils, it persecutes them everywhere, in the
temples, at the altars once of the ancient worship,
then of the heathen martyrs. Let there be more
feasts?&mdash;they will likely be so many gatherings of idolaters.
The Family itself becomes suspected: for
custom might bring it together round the ancient
Lares. And why should there be a family?&mdash;the
empire is an empire of monks.</p>

<p>But the individual man himself, thus dumb and
isolated though he be, still watches the sky, still
honours his ancient gods whom he finds anew in the
stars. &#8220;This is he,&#8221; said the Emperor Theodosius,
&#8220;who causes famines and all the plagues of the
empire.&#8221; Those terrible words turned the blind rage
of the people loose upon the harmless Pagan. Blindly
the law unchained all its furies against the law.</p>

<p>Ye gods of Eld, depart into your tombs! Get ye
extinguished, gods of Love, of Life, of Light! Put
on the monk&#8217;s cowl. Maidens, become nuns. Wives,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
forsake your husbands; or, if ye will look after the
house, be unto them but cold sisters.</p>

<p>But is all this possible? What man&#8217;s breath shall
be strong enough to put out at one effort the burning
lamp of God? These rash endeavours of an impious
piety may evoke miracles strange and monstrous.
Tremble, guilty that ye are!</p>

<p>Often in the Middle Ages will recur the mournful
tale of the Bride of Corinth. Told at a happy moment
by Phlegon, Adrian&#8217;s freedman, it meets us again in the
twelfth, and yet again in the sixteenth century, as the
deep reproof, the invincible protest of nature herself.</p>

<hr />

<p>&#8220;A young man of Athens went to Corinth, to the
house of one who had promised him his daughter.
Himself being still a heathen, he knew not that the
family which he thought to enter had just turned
Christian. It is very late when he arrives. They are
all gone to rest, except the mother, who serves up for
him the hospitable repast and then leaves him to sleep.
Dead tired, he drops down. Scarce was he fallen
asleep, when a figure entered the room: &#8217;tis a girl all
clothed and veiled in white; on her forehead a fillet of
black and gold. She sees him. In amazement she
lifts her white hand: &#8216;Am I, then, such a stranger in
the house already? Alas, poor recluse!... But I
am ashamed, and withdraw. Sleep on.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Stay, fair maiden! Here are Bacchus, Ceres, and
with thee comes Love. Fear not, look not so pale!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Ah! Away from me, young man! I have nothing
more to do with happiness. By a vow my
mother made in her sickness my youth and my life are
bound for ever. The gods have fled, and human
victims now are our only sacrifices.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Ha! can it be thou, thou, my darling betrothed,
who wast given me from my childhood? The oath of
our fathers bound us for evermore under the blessing
of heaven. Maiden, be mine!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;No, my friend, not I. Thou shalt have my
younger sister. If I moan in my chilly dungeon, do
thou in her arms think of me, of me wasting away
and thinking only of thee; of me whom the earth is
about to cover again.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Nay, I swear by this flame, the torch of Hymen,
thou shalt come home with me to my father. Rest
thee, my own beloved.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;As a wedding-gift he offers her a cup of gold. She
gives him her chain, but instead of the cup desires a
curl of his hair.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is the hour of spirits; her pale lip drinks up the
dark blood-red wine. He too drinks greedily after
her. He calls on the god of Love. She still resisted,
though her poor heart was dying thereat. But he
grows desperate, and falls weeping on the couch.
Anon she throws herself by his side.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Oh! how ill thy sorrow makes me! Yet, if thou
wast to touch me&mdash;&mdash; Oh, horror!&mdash;white as the snow,
and cold as ice, such, ah me! is thy bride.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;I will warm thee again: come to me, wert thou
come from the very grave.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sighs and kisses many do they exchange.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Dost thou feel how warm I am?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Love twines and holds them fast. Tears mingle
with their joy. She changes with the fire she drinks
from his mouth: her icy blood is aglow with passion;
but the heart in her bosom will not beat.</p>

<p>&#8220;But the mother was there listening. Soft vows,
cries of wailing and of pleasure.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Hush, the cock is crowing: to-morrow night!&#8217;
Then with kiss on kiss they say farewell.</p>

<p>&#8220;In wrath the mother enters; sees what? Her
daughter. He would have hidden her, covered her
up. But freeing herself from him, she grew from
the couch up to the roof.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;O mother, mother, you grudge me a pleasant
night; you would drive me from this cosy spot! Was
it not enough to have wrapped me in my winding-sheet
and borne me to the grave? A greater power
has lifted up the stone. In vain did your priests
drone over the trench they dug for me. Of what use
are salt and water, where burns the fire of youth?
The earth cannot freeze up love. You made a promise;
I have just reclaimed my own.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Alas, dear friend, thou must die: thou wouldst
but pine and dry up here. I have thy hair; it will
be white to-morrow.... Mother, one last prayer!
Open my dark dungeon, set up a stake, and let the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
loving one find rest in the flames. Let the sparks fly
upward and the ashes redden. We will go to our
olden gods.&#8217;&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

noble in the form, is not so in the spirit of his poem. He spoils

the maiden into a vampire. She comes because she thirsts for
blood, that she may suck the blood from his heart. And he
makes her coldly say this impious and unclean thing: &#8220;When
I have done with him, I will pass on to others: the young
blood shall fall a prey to my fury.&#8221;
</p><p>
In the Middle Ages this story put on a grotesque garb, by
way of frightening us with the <i>Devil Venus</i>. On the finger of
her statue a young man imprudently places a ring, which she
clasps tight, guarding it like a bride, and going in the night
to his couch, to assert her rights. He cannot rid himself of
his infernal spouse without an exorcism. The same tale,
foolishly applied to the Virgin, is found in the <i>Fabliaux</i>. If
my memory does not mislead me, Luther also, in his &#8220;Table
Talk,&#8221; takes up the old story in a very coarse way, till you
quite smell the body. The Spanish Del Rio shifts the scene of
it to Brabant. The bride dies shortly before her marriage;
the death-bells are rung. The bridegroom rushed wildly over
the country. He hears a wail. It is she herself wandering
about the heath. &#8220;Seest thou not&#8221;&mdash;she says&mdash;&#8220;who leads
me?&#8221; But he catches her up and bears her home. At this
point the story threatened to become too moving; but the hard
inquisitor, Del Rio, cuts the thread. &#8220;On lifting her veil,&#8221;
says he, &#8220;they found only a log of wood covered with the skin
of a corpse.&#8221; The Judge le Loyer, silly though he be, has
restored the older version.
</p><p>
Thenceforth these gloomy taletellers come to an end. The
story is useless when our own age begins; for then the bride
has triumphed. Nature comes back from the grave, not by
stealth, but as mistress of the house.</p></div>

<h3>WHY THE MIDDLE AGES FELL INTO DESPAIR.</h3>


<p class="noind">&#8220;<span class="smcap">Be</span> ye as newborn babes (<i>quasi modo geniti infantes</i>);
be thoroughly childlike in the innocence of your hearts;
peaceful, forgetting all disputes, calmly resting under
the hand of Christ.&#8221; Such is the kindly counsel
tendered by the Church to this stormy world on the
morning after the great fall. In other words: &#8220;Volcanoes,
ruins, ashes, and lava, become green. Ye
parched plains, get covered with flowers.&#8221;</p>

<p>One thing indeed gave promise of the peace that
reneweth: the schools were all shut up, the way of
logic forsaken. A method infinitely simple for the
doing away with argument, offered all men a gentle
slope, down which they had nothing to do but go. If
the creed was doubtful, the life was all traced out in
the pathway of the legend. From first to last but the
one word <i>Imitation</i>.</p>

<p>&#8220;Imitate, and all will go well. Rehearse and copy.&#8221;
But is this the way to that true childhood which quickens
the heart of man, which leads back to its fresh and
fruitful springs? In this world that is to make us
young and childlike, I see at first nothing but the
tokens of age; only cunning, slavishness, want of power.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
What kind of literature is this, confronted with the
glorious monuments of Greeks and Jews? We have
just the same literary fall as happened in India from
Brahminism to Buddhism; a twaddling flow of words
after a noble inspiration. Books copy from books,
churches from churches, until they cannot so much as
copy. They pillage from each other: Aix-la-Chapelle
is adorned with the marbles torn from Ravenna. It is
the same with all the social life of those days. The
bishop-king of a city, the savage king of a tribe, alike
copy the Roman magistrates. Original as one might
deem them, our monks in their monasteries simply
restored their ancient <i>Villa</i>, as Chateaubriand well said.
They had no notion either of forming a new society or
of fertilizing the old. Copying from the monks of the
East, they wanted their servants at first to be themselves
a barren race of monkling workmen. It was in
spite of them that the family in renewing itself renewed
the world.</p>

<p>Seeing how fast these oldsters keep on oldening;
how in one age we fall from the wise monk St. Benedict
down to the pedantic Benedict of Aniane;<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> we
feel that such gentry were wholly guiltless of that great
popular creation which bloomed amidst ruins; namely,
the Lives of the Saints. If the monks wrote, it was
the people made them. This young growth might
throw out some leaves and flowers from the crannies of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>an old Roman ruin turned into a convent: but most
assuredly not thence did it first arise. Its roots go
deep into the ground: sown by the people and cultivated
by the family, it takes help from every hand,
from men, from women, from children. The precarious,
troubled life of those days of violence, made these poor
folk imaginative, prone to believe in their own dreams,
as being to them full of comfort: strange dreams
withal, rich in marvels, in fooleries; absurd, but charming.</p>

<p>These families, isolated in forests and mountains, as
we still see them in the Tyrol or the Higher Alps, and
coming down thence but once a week, never wanted for
illusions in the desert. One child had seen this, some
woman had dreamed that. A new saint began to rise.
The story went abroad in the shape of a ballad with
doggrel rhymes. They sang and danced to it of an
evening at the oak by the fountain. The priest, when
he came on Sunday to perform service in the woodland
chapel, found the legendary chant already in every
mouth. He said to himself, &#8220;After all, history is
good, is edifying.... It does honour to the Church.
<i>Vox populi, vox Dei!</i>&mdash;But how did they light upon
it?&#8221; He could be shown the true, the irrefragable
proofs of it in some tree or stone which had witnessed
the apparition, had marked the miracle. What can he
say to that?</p>

<p>Brought back to the abbey, the tale will find a monk
good for nothing, who can only write; who is curious,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
believes everything, no matter how marvellous. It is
written out, broidered with his dull rhetoric, and spoilt
a little. But now it has come forth, confirmed and
consecrated, to be read in the refectory, ere long in
the church. Copied, loaded and overloaded with ornaments
chiefly grotesque, it will go on from age to age,
until at last it comes to take high rank in the Golden
Legend.</p>

<hr />

<p>When those fair stories are read again to us in these
days, even as we listen to the simple, grave, artless airs
into which those rural peoples threw all their young
heart, we cannot help marking a great inspiration;
and we are moved to pity as we reflect upon their fate.</p>

<p>They had taken literally the touching advice of the
Church: &#8220;Be ye as newborn babes.&#8221; But they gave
to it a meaning, the very last that one would dream of
finding in the original thought. As much as Christianity
feared and hated Nature, even so much did these
others cherish her, deeming her all guileless, hallowing
her even in the legends wherewith they mingled
her up.</p>

<p>Those <i>hairy</i> animals, as the Bible sharply calls them,
animals mistrusted by the monks who fear to find
devils among them, enter in the most touching way
into these beautiful stories; as the hind, for instance,
who refreshes and comforts Genevi&egrave;ve of Brabant.</p>

<p>Even outside the life of legends, in the common
everyday world, the humble friends of his hearth, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
bold helpmates of his work, rise again in man&#8217;s esteem.
They have their own laws,<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> their own festivals. If in
God&#8217;s unbounded goodness there is room for the smallest
creatures, if He seems to show them a pitying preference,
&#8220;Wherefore,&#8221; says the countryman, &#8220;should
my ass not have entered the church? Doubtless, he
has his faults, wherein he only resembles me the more.
He is a rough worker, but has a hard head; is intractable,
stubborn, headstrong; in short, just like myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thence come those wonderful feasts, the fairest of
the Middle Ages; feasts of <i>Innocents</i>, of <i>Fools</i>, of the
<i>Ass</i>. It is the people itself, moreover, which, in the
shape of an ass, draws about its own image, presents
itself before the altar, ugly, comical, abased. Verily, a
touching sight! Led by Balaam, he enters solemnly
between Virgil and the Sibyl;<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> enters that he may
bear witness. If he kicked of yore against Balaam,
it was that before him he beheld the sword of the ancient
law. But here the law is ended, and the world
of grace seems opening its two-leaved gate to the mean
and to the simple. The people innocently believes it
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>all. Thereon comes that lofty hymn, in which it says
to the ass what it might have said to itself:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza" style="margin-bottom: 0em">

<p>How bold and coarse ye are! Was it this we asked
of you, children rash and wayward, when we told you
to be as children? We offered you milk; you are
drinking wine. We led you softly, bridle in hand,
along the narrow path. Mild and fearful, ye hesitated
to go forward: and now, all at once, the bridle is broken;
the course is cleared at a single bound. Ah! how
foolish we were to let you make your own saints; to
dress out the altar; to deck, to burden, to cover it up
with flowers! Why, it is hardly distinguishable! And
what we do see is the old heresy condemned of the
Church, <i>the innocence of nature</i>: what am I saying?&mdash;a
new heresy, not like to end to-morrow, <i>the independence
of man</i>.</p>

<p>Listen and obey!&mdash;You are forbidden to invent, to
create. No more legends, no more new saints: we
have had enough of them. You are forbidden to introduce
new chants in your worship: inspiration is not
allowed. The martyrs you would bring to light should
stay modestly within their tombs, waiting to be recognised
by the Church. The clergy, the monks are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
forbidden to grant the tonsure of civil freedom to
husbandmen and serfs. Such is the narrow fearful
spirit that fills the Church of the Carlovingian days.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
She unsays her words, she gives herself the lie, she
says to the children, &#8220;Be old!&#8221;</p>

<hr />

<p>A fall indeed! But is this earnest? They had
bidden us all be young.&mdash;Ah! but priest and people
are no longer one. A divorce without end begins, a
gulf unpassable divides them for ever. The priest
himself, a lord and prince, will come out in his golden
cope, and chant in the royal speech of that great
empire which is no more. For ourselves, a mournful
company, bereft of human speech, of the only speech
that God would care to hear, what else can we do but
low and bleat with the guileless friends who never
scorn us, who, in winter-time will keep us warm in
their stable, or cover us with their fleeces? We will
live with dumb beasts, and be dumb ourselves.</p>

<p>In sooth there is less need than before for our going
to church. But the church will not hold us free: she
insists on our returning to hear what we no longer
understand. Thenceforth a mighty fog, a fog heavy
and dun as lead, enwraps the world. For how long?
For a whole millennium of horror. Throughout ten
centuries, a languor unknown to all former times seizes
upon the Middle Ages, even in part on those latter
days that come midway betwixt sleep and waking, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>holds them under the sway of a visitation most irksome,
most unbearable; that convulsion, namely, of
mental weariness, which men call a fit of yawning.</p>

<p>When the tireless bell rings at the wonted hours,
they yawn; while the nasal chant is singing in the old
Latin words, they yawn. It is all foreseen, there is
nothing to hope for in the world, everything will come
round just the same as before. The certainty of being
bored to-morrow sets one yawning from to-day; and
the long vista of wearisome days, of wearisome years to
come, weighs men down, sickens them from the first
with living. From brain to stomach, from stomach to
mouth, the fatal fit spreads of its own accord, and keeps
on distending the jaws without end or remedy. An
actual disease the pious Bretons call it, ascribing it,
however, to the malice of the Devil. He keeps crouching
in the woods, the peasants say: if anyone passes
by tending his cattle, he sings to him vespers and
other rites, until he is dead with yawning.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<hr />

<p><i>To be old</i> is to be weak. When the Saracens, when
the Norsemen threaten us, what will come to us if the
people remain old? Charlemagne weeps, and the
Church weeps too. She owns that her relics fail to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>guard her altars from these Barbarian devils.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> Had
she not better call upon the arm of that wayward
child whom she was going to bind fast, the arm of that
young giant whom she wanted to paralyse? This
movement in two opposite ways fills the whole ninth
century. The people are held back, anon they are
hurled forward: we fear them and we call on them for
aid. With them and by means of them we throw up
hasty barriers, defences that may check the Barbarians,
while sheltering the priests and their saints escaped
thither from their churches.</p>

<p>In spite of the Bald Emperor&#8217;s<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> command not to
build, there grows up a tower on the mountain.
Thither comes the fugitive, crying, &#8220;In God&#8217;s name,
take me in, at least my wife and children! Myself
with my cattle will encamp in your outer enclosure.&#8221;
The tower emboldens him and he feels himself a man.
It gives him shade, and he in his turn defends, protects
his protector.</p>

<p>Formerly in their hunger the small folk yielded
themselves to the great as serfs; but here how great
the difference! He offers himself as a <i>vassal</i>, one who
would be called brave and valiant.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> He gives himself
up, and keeps himself, and reserves to himself the
right of going elsewhere. &#8220;I will go further: the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>earth is large: I, too, like the rest, can rear my tower
yonder. If I have defended the outworks, I can surely
look after myself within.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thus nobly, thus grandly arose the feudal world.
The master of the tower received his vassals with some
such words as these: &#8220;Thou shalt go when thou
willest, and if need be with my help; at least, if thou
shouldst sink in the mire, I myself will dismount to
succour thee.&#8221; These are the very words of the old
formula.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<hr />

<p>But, one day, what do I see? Can my sight be
grown dim? The lord of the valley, as he rides about,
sets up bounds that none may overleap; ay, and
limits that you cannot see. &#8220;What is that? I don&#8217;t
understand.&#8221; That means that the manor is shut in.
&#8220;The lord keeps it all fast under gate and hinge,
between heaven and earth.&#8221;</p>

<p>Most horrible! By virtue of what law is this <i>vassus</i>
(or <i>valiant</i> one) held to his power? People will thereon
have it, that <i>vassus</i> may also mean <i>slave</i>. In like
manner the word <i>servus</i>, meaning a <i>servant</i>, often
indeed a proud one, even a Count or Prince of the
Empire, comes in the case of the weak to signify a <i>serf</i>,
a wretch whose life is hardly worth a halfpenny.</p>

<p>In this damnable net are they caught. But down
yonder, on his ground, is a man who avers that his land
is free, a <i>freehold</i>, a <i>fief of the sun</i>. Seated on his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>boundary-stone, with hat pressed firmly down, he looks
at Count or Emperor passing near. &#8220;Pass on, Emperor;
go thy ways! If thou art firm on thy horse,
yet more am I on my pillar. Thou mayest pass, but so
will not I: for I am Freedom.&#8221;</p>

<p>But I lack courage to say what becomes of this man.
The air grows thick around him: he breathes less and
less freely. He seems to be <i>under a spell</i>: he cannot
move: he is as one paralysed. His very beasts grow
thin, as if a charm had been thrown over them. His
servants die of hunger. His land bears nothing now;
spirits sweep it clean by night.</p>

<p>Still he holds on: &#8220;The poor man is a king in his
own house.&#8221; But he is not to be let alone. He gets
summoned, must answer for himself in the Imperial
Court. So he goes, like an old-world spectre, whom
no one knows any more. &#8220;What is he?&#8221; ask the
young. &#8220;Ah, he is neither a lord, nor a serf! Yet
even then is he nothing?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who am I? I am he who built the first tower, he
who succoured you, he who, leaving the tower, went
boldly forth to meet the Norse heathens at the bridge.
Yet more, I dammed the river, I tilled the meadow,
creating the land itself by drawing it God-like out of
the waters. From this land who shall drive me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, my friend,&#8221; says a neighbour&mdash;&#8220;you shall
not be driven away. You shall till this land, but in a
way you little think for. Remember, my good fellow,
how in your youth, some fifty years ago, you were rash<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
enough to wed my father&#8217;s little serf, Jacqueline.
Remember the proverb, &#8216;He who courts my hen is my
cock.&#8217; You belong to my fowl-yard. Ungird yourself;
throw away your sword! From this day forth
you are my serf.&#8221;</p>

<p>There is no invention here. The dreadful tale recurs
incessantly during the Middle Ages. Ah, it was a
sharp sword that stabbed him. I have abridged and
suppressed much, for as often as one returns to these
times, the same steel, the same sharp point, pierces
right through the heart.</p>

<p>There was one among them who, under this gross
insult, fell into so deep a rage that he could not bring
up a single word. It was like Roland betrayed. His
blood all rushed upwards into his throat. His flaming
eyes, his mouth so dumb, yet so fearfully eloquent,
turned all the assembly pale. They started back. He
was dead: his veins had burst. His arteries spurted
the red blood over the faces of his murderers.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<hr />

<p>The doubtful state of men&#8217;s affairs, the frightfully
slippery descent by which the freeman becomes a
vassal, the vassal a servant, and the servant a serf,&mdash;in
these things lie the great terror of the Middle Ages,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>and the depth of their despair. There is no way of
escape therefrom; for he who takes one step is lost.
He is an <i>alien</i>, a <i>stray</i>, a <i>wild beast of the chase</i>. The
ground grows slimy to catch his feet, roots him, as he
passes, to the spot. The contagion in the air kills
him; he becomes a thing <i>in mortmain</i>, a dead creature,
a mere nothing, a beast, a soul worth twopence-halfpenny,
whose murder can be atoned for by twopence-halfpenny.</p>

<p>These are outwardly the two great leading traits in
the wretchedness of the Middle Ages, through which
they came to give themselves up to the Devil. Meanwhile
let us look within, and sound the innermost
depths of their moral life.</p>

<h3>THE LITTLE DEVIL OF THE FIRESIDE.</h3>


<p class="noind"><span class="smcap">There</span> is an air of dreaming about those earlier centuries
of the Middle Ages, in which the legends were
self-conceived. Among countryfolk so gently submissive,
as these legends show them, to the Church,
you would readily suppose that very great innocence
might be found. This is surely the temple of God
the Father. And yet the <i>penitentiaries</i>, wherein reference
is made to ordinary sins, speak of strange
defilements, of things afterwards rare enough under
the rule of Satan.</p>

<p>These sprang from two causes, from the utter ignorance
of the times, and from the close intermingling
of near kindred under one roof. They seem to have
had but a slight acquaintance with our modern ethics.
Those of their day, all counterpleas notwithstanding,
resemble the ethics of the patriarchs, of that far antiquity
which regarded marriage with a stranger as
immoral, and allowed only of marriage amongst kinsfolk.
The families thus joined together became as
one. Not daring to scatter over the surrounding
deserts, tilling only the outskirts of a Merovingian
palace or a monastery, they took shelter every evening
under the roof of a large homestead (<i>villa</i>). Thence<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
arose unpleasant points of analogy with the ancient
<i>ergastulum</i>, where the slaves of an estate were all
crammed together. Many of these communities lasted
through and even beyond the Middle Ages. About
the results of such a system the lord would feel very
little concern. To his eyes but one family was visible
in all this tribe, this multitude of people &#8220;who rose
and lay down together, ... who ate together of the
same bread, and drank out of the same mug.&#8221;</p>

<p>Amidst such confusion the woman was not much
regarded. Her place was by no means lofty. If the
virgin, the ideal woman, rose higher from age to age,
the real woman was held of little worth among these
boorish masses, in this medley of men and herds.
Wretched was the doom of a condition which could only
change with the growth of separate dwellings, when
men at length took courage to live apart in hamlets,
or to build them huts in far-off forest-clearings, amidst
the fruitful fields they had gone out to cultivate. From
the lonely hearth comes the true family. It is the nest
that forms the bird. Thenceforth they were no more
things, but men; for then also was the woman born.</p>

<hr />

<p>It was a very touching moment, the day she entered
<i>her own home</i>. Then at last the poor wretch might
become pure and holy. There, as she sits spinning
alone, while her goodman is in the forest, she may
brood on some thought and dream away. Her damp,
ill-fastened cabin, through which keeps whistling the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
winter wind, is still, by way of a recompense, calm
and silent. In it are sundry dim corners where the
housewife lodges her dreams.</p>

<p>And by this time she has some property, something
of her own. The <i>distaff</i>, the <i>bed</i>, and the <i>trunk</i>, are
all she has, according to the old song.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> We may add
a table, a seat, perhaps two stools. A poor dwelling
and very bare; but then it is furnished with a living
soul! The fire cheers her, the blessed box-twigs
guard her bed, accompanied now and again by a pretty
bunch of vervein. Seated by her door, the lady of
this palace spins and watches some sheep. We are
not yet rich enough to keep a cow; but to that we
may come in time, if Heaven will bless our house.
The wood, a bit of pasture, and some bees about our
ground&mdash;such is our way of life! But little corn is
cultivated as yet, there being no assurance of a harvest
so long of coming. Such a life, however needy, is
anyhow less hard for the woman: she is not broken
down and withered, as she will be in the days of large
farming. And she has more leisure withal. You
must never judge of her by the coarse literature of
the Fabliaux and the Christmas Carols, by the foolish
laughter and license of the filthy tales we have to put
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>up with by and by. She is alone; without a neighbour.
The bad, unwholesome life of the dark, little,
walled towns, the mutual spyings, the wretched dangerous
gossipings, have not yet begun. No old
woman comes of an evening, when the narrow street
is growing dark, to tempt the young maiden by saying
how for the love of her somebody is dying. She has
no friend but her own reflections; she converses only
with her beasts or the tree in the forest.</p>

<p>Such things speak to her, we know of what. They
recall to her mind the saws once uttered by her mother
and grandmother; ancient saws handed down for ages
from woman to woman. They form a harmless reminder
of the old country spirits, a touching family
religion which doubtless had little power in the blustering
hurly-burly of a great common dwellinghouse,
but now comes back again to haunt the lonely cabin.</p>

<p>It is a singular, a delicate world of fays and hobgoblins,
made for a woman&#8217;s soul. When the great
creation of the saintly Legend gets stopped and dried
up, that other older, more poetic legend comes in for
its share of welcome; reigns privily with gentle sway.
It is the woman&#8217;s treasure; she worships and caresses
it. The fay, too, is a woman, a fantastic mirror wherein
she sees herself in a fairer guise.</p>

<p>Who were these fays? Tradition says, that of yore
some Gaulish queens, being proud and fanciful, did on
the coming of Christ and His Apostles behave so insolently
as to turn their backs upon them. In Brittany<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
they were dancing at the moment, and never stopped
dancing. Hence their hard doom; they are condemned
to live until the Day of Judgment.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> Many of
them were turned into mice or rabbits; as the Kow-riggwans
for instance, or Elves, who meeting at night
round the old Druidic stones entangle you in their
dances. The same fate befell the pretty Queen Mab,
who made herself a royal chariot out of a walnut-shell.
They are all rather whimsical, and sometimes ill-humoured.
But can we be surprised at them, remembering
their woeful lot? Tiny and odd as they are,
they have a heart, a longing to be loved. They are
good and they are bad and full of fancies. On the
birth of a baby they come down the chimney, to endow
it and order its future. They are fond of good spinning-women&mdash;they
even spin divinely themselves. Do
we not talk of <i>spinning like a fairy</i>?</p>

<p>The fairy-tales, stripped of the absurd embellishments
in which the latest compilers muffled them up, express
the heart of the people itself. They mark a poetic
interval between the gross communism of the primitive
<i>villa</i>, and the looseness of the time when a growing
burgess-class made our cynical Fabliaux.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>These tales have an historical side, reminding us, in
the ogres, &amp;c., of the great famines. But commonly
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>they soar higher than any history, on the <i>Blue Bird&#8217;s</i>
wing, in a realm of eternal poesy; telling us our
wishes which never vary, the unchangeable history of
the heart.</p>

<p>The poor serf&#8217;s longing to breathe, to rest, to find a
treasure that may end his sufferings, continually returns.
More often, through a lofty aspiration, this
treasure becomes a soul as well, a treasure of love
asleep, as in <i>The Sleeping Beauty</i>: but not seldom the
charming person finds herself by some fatal enchantment
hidden under a mask. Hence that touching trilogy,
that admirable <i>crescendo</i> of <i>Riquet with the Tuft</i>,
<i>Ass&#8217;s Skin</i>, and <i>Beauty and the Beast</i>. Love will not
be discouraged. Through all that ugliness it follows
after and gains the hidden beauty. In the last of these
tales that feeling touches the sublime, and I think that
no one has ever read it without weeping.</p>

<p>A passion most real, most sincere, lurks beneath it&mdash;that
unhappy, hopeless love, which unkind nature often
sets between poor souls of very different ranks in life.
On the one hand is the grief of the peasant maid at
not being able to make herself fair enough to win the
cavalier&#8217;s fancy; on the other the smothered sighs of
the serf, when along his furrow he sees passing, on a
white horse, too exquisite a glory, the beautiful, the
majestic Lady of the Castle. So in the East arises
the mournful idyll of the impossible loves of the Rose
and the Nightingale. Nevertheless, there is one
great difference: the bird and the flower are both<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
beautiful; nay, are alike in their beauty. But here
the humbler being, doomed to a place so far below,
avows to himself that he is ugly and monstrous. But
amidst his wailing he feels in himself a power greater
than the East can know. With the will of a hero,
through the very greatness of his desire, he breaks out
of his idle coverings. He loves so much, this monster,
that he is loved, and, in return, through that love
grows beautiful.</p>

<p>An infinite tenderness pervades it all. This soul
enchanted thinks not of itself alone. It busies itself
in saving all nature and all society as well. Victims
of every kind, the child beaten by its step-mother, the
youngest sister slighted, ill-used by her elders, are the
surest objects of its liking. Even to the Lady of the
Castle does its compassion extend; it mourns her fallen
into the hands of so fierce a lord as Blue-Beard. It
yearns with pity towards the beasts; it seeks to console
them for being still in the shape of animals. Let them
be patient, and their day will come. Some day their
prisoned souls shall put on wings, shall be free, lovely,
and beloved. This is the other side of <i>Ass&#8217;s Skin</i>
and such like stories. There especially we are sure of
finding a woman&#8217;s heart. The rude labourer in the
fields may be hard enough to his beasts, but to the
woman they are no beasts. She regards them with the
feeling of a child. To her fancy all is human, all is
soul: the whole world becomes ennobled. It is a beautiful
enchantment. Humble as she is, and ugly as she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
thinks herself, she has given all her beauty, all her
grace to the surrounding universe.</p>

<hr />

<p>Is she, then, so ugly, this little peasant-wife, whose
dreaming fancy feeds on things like these? I tell you
she keeps house, she spins and minds the flock, she
visits the forest to gather a little wood. As yet she has
neither the hard work nor the ugly looks of the
countrywoman as afterwards fashioned by the prevalent
culture of grain crops. Nor is she like the fat townswife,
heavy and slothful, about whom our fathers made
such a number of fat stories. She has no sense of
safety; she is meek and timid, and feels herself, as it
were, in God&#8217;s hand. On yonder hill she can see the
dark frowning castle, whence a thousand harms may
come upon her. Her husband she holds in equal fear
and honour. A serf elsewhere, by her side he is a
king. For him she saves of her best, living herself on
nothing. She is small and slender like the women-saints
of the Church. The poor feeding of those
days must needs make women fine-bred, but lacking
also in vital strength. The children die off in vast
numbers: those pale roses are all nerves. Hence, will
presently burst forth the epileptic dances of the fourteenth
century. Meanwhile, towards the twelfth century,
there come to be two weaknesses attached to this
state of half-grown youth: by night somnambulism;
in the daytime seeing of visions, trance, and the gift
of tears.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p><hr />

<p>This woman, for all her innocence, still has a secret
which the Church may never be told. Locked up in
her heart she bears the pitying remembrance of those
poor old gods who have fallen into the state of
spirits;<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> and spirits, you must know, are not exempt
from suffering. Dwelling in rocks, and in hearts of
oak, they are very unhappy in winter; being particularly
fond of warmth. They ramble about houses;
they are sometimes seen in stables warming themselves
beside the beasts. Bereft of incense and burnt-offerings,
they sometimes take of the milk. The housewife
being thrifty, will not stint her husband, but
lessens her own share, and in the evening leaves a
little cream.</p>

<p>Those spirits who only appear at night, regret their
banishment from the day and are greedy of lamplight.
By night the housewife starts on her perilous trip,
bearing a small lantern, to the great oak where they
dwell, or to the secret fountain whose mirror, as it
multiplies the flame, may cheer up those sorrowful
outlaws.</p>

<p>But if anyone should know of it, good heavens!
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>Her husband is canny and fears the Church: he would
certainly give her a beating. The priest wages fierce
war with the sprites, and hunts them out of every
place. Yet he might leave them their dwelling in the
oaks! What harm can they do in the forest? Alas!
no: from council to council they are hunted down.
On set days the priest will go even to the oak, and
with prayers and holy water drive away the spirits.</p>

<p>How would it be if no kind soul took pity on them?
This woman, however, will take them under her care.
She is an excellent Christian, but will keep for them
one corner of her heart. To them alone can she
entrust those little natural affairs, which, harmless as
they are in a chaste wife&#8217;s dwelling, the Church
at any rate would count as blameworthy. They are
the confidants, the confessors of these touching womanly
secrets. Of them she thinks, when she puts
the holy log on the fire. It is Christmastide; but
also is it the ancient festival of the Northern spirits,
the <i>Feast of the Longest Night</i>. So, too, the Eve of
May-day is the <i>Pervigilium of Maia</i>, when the tree
is planted. So, too, with the Eve of St. John, the
true feast-day of life, of flowers, and newly-awakened
love. She who has no children makes it her especial
duty to cherish these festivals, and to offer them a
deep devotion. A vow to the Virgin would perhaps be
of little avail, it being no concern of Mary&#8217;s. In a
low whisper, she prefers addressing some ancient
<i>genius</i>, worshipped in other days as a rustic deity, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
afterwards by the kindness of some local church transformed
into a saint.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> And thus it happens that the
bed, the cradle, all the sweetest mysteries on which the
chaste and loving soul can brood, belong to the olden
gods.</p>

<hr />

<p>Nor are the sprites ungrateful. One day she awakes,
and without having stirred a finger, finds all her housekeeping
done. In her amazement she makes the sign
of the cross and says nothing. When the good man
goes she questions herself, but in vain. It must have
been a spirit. &#8220;What can it be? How came it here?
How I should like to see it! But I am afraid: they
say it is death to see a spirit.&#8221;&mdash;Yet the cradle moves
and swings of itself. She is clasped by some one, and
a voice so soft, so low that she took it for her own, is
heard saying, &#8220;Dearest mistress, I love to rock your
babe, because I am myself a babe.&#8221; Her heart beats,
and yet she takes courage a little. The innocence of
the cradle gives this spirit also an innocent air, causing
her to believe it good, gentle, suffered at least by
God.</p>

<p>From that day forth she is no longer alone. She
readily feels its presence, and it is never far from her.
It rubs her gown, and she hears the grazing. It rambles
momently about her, and plainly cannot leave her
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>side. If she goes to the stable, it is there; and she
believes that the other day it was in the churn.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>Pity she cannot take it up and look at it! Once,
when she suddenly touched the brands, she fancied
she saw the tricksy little thing tumbling about in the
sparks; another time she missed catching it in a rose.
Small as it is, it works, sweeps, arranges, saves her a
thousand cares.</p>

<p>It has its faults, however; is giddy, bold, and if she
did not hold it fast, might perhaps shake itself free. It
observes and listens too much. It repeats sometimes
of a morning some little word she had whispered very,
very softly on going to bed, when the light was put out.
She knows it to be very indiscreet, exceedingly curious.
She is irked with feeling herself always followed about,
complains of it, and likes complaining. Sometimes,
having threatened him and turned him off, she feels
herself quite at ease. But just then she finds herself
caressed by a light breathing, as it were a bird&#8217;s wing.
He was under a leaf. He laughs: his gentle voice, free
from mocking, declares the joy he felt in taking his
chaste young mistress by surprise. On her making a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>show of great wrath, &#8220;No, my darling, my little pet,&#8221;
says the monkey, &#8220;you are not a bit sorry to have
me here.&#8221;</p>

<p>She feels ashamed and dares say nothing more. But
she guesses now that she loves him overmuch. She has
scruples about it, and loves him yet more. All night
she seems to feel him creeping up to her bed. In her
fear she prays to God, and keeps close to her husband.
What shall she do? She has not the strength to tell
the Church. She tells her husband, who laughs at first
incredulously. Then she owns to a little more,&mdash;what
a madcap the goblin is, sometimes even overbold.
&#8220;What matters? He is so small.&#8221; Thus he himself
sets her mind at ease.</p>

<p>Should we too feel reassured, we who can see more
clearly? She is quite innocent still. She would shrink
from copying the great lady up there who, in the face
of her husband, has her court of lovers and her page.
Let us own, however, that to that point the goblin has
already smoothed the way. One could not have a more
perilous page than he who hides himself under a rose;
and, moreover, he smacks of the lover. More intrusive
than anyone else, he is so tiny that he can creep
anywhere.</p>

<p>He glides even into the husband&#8217;s heart, paying him
court and winning his good graces. He looks after
his tools, works in his garden, and of an evening, by
way of reward, curls himself up in the chimney, behind
the babe and the cat. They hear his small voice, just<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
like a cricket&#8217;s; but they never see much of him, save
when a faint glimmer lights a certain cranny in which
he loves to stay. Then they see, or think they see, a
thin little face; and cry out, &#8220;Ah! little one, we have
seen you at last!&#8221;</p>

<p>In church they are told to mistrust the spirits, for
even one that seems innocent, and glides about like a
light breeze, may after all be a devil. They take good
care not to believe it. His size begets a belief in his
innocence. Whilst he is there, they thrive. The husband
holds to him as much as the wife, and perhaps
more. He sees that the tricksy little elf makes the
fortune of the house.</p>

<h3>TEMPTATIONS.</h3>


<p class="noind"><span class="smcap">I have</span> kept this picture clear of those dreadful
shadows of the hour by which it would have been
sadly overdarkened. I refer especially to the uncertainty
attending the lot of these rural households, to
their constant fear and foreboding of some casual
outrage which might at any moment descend on them
from the castle.</p>

<p>There were just two things which made the feudal
rule a hell: on one hand, its <i>exceeding steadfastness</i>,
man being nailed, as it were, to the ground, and
emigration made impossible; on the other, a very
great degree of <i>uncertainty</i> about his lot.</p>

<p>The optimist historians who say so much about
fixed rents, charters, buying of immunities, forget how
slightly all this was guaranteed. So much you were
bound to pay the lord, but all the rest he could take
if he chose; and this was very fitly called the <i>right of
seizure</i>. You may work and work away, my good
fellow! But while you are in the fields, yon dreaded
band from the castle will fall upon your house and
carry off whatever they please &#8220;for their lord&#8217;s service.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>Look again at that man standing with his head
bowed gloomily over the furrow! And thus he is
always found, his face clouded, his heart oppressed, as
if he were expecting some evil news. Is he meditating
some wrongful deed? No; but there are two ideas
haunting him, two daggers piercing him in turn.
The one is, &#8220;In what state shall I find my house
this evening?&#8221; The other, &#8220;Would that the turning
up of this sod might bring some treasure to
light! O that the good spirit would help to buy us
free!&#8221;</p>

<p>We are assured that, after the fashion of the
Etruscan spirit which one day started up from under
the ploughshare in the form of a child, a dwarf or
gnome of the tiniest stature would sometimes on such
an appeal come forth from the ground, and, setting
itself on the furrow, would say, &#8220;What wantest thou?&#8221;
But in his amazement the poor man would ask for
nothing; he would turn pale, cross himself, and presently
go quite away.</p>

<p>Did he never feel sorry afterwards? Said he never
to himself, &#8220;Fool that you are, you will always be unlucky?&#8221;
I readily believe he did; but I also think
that a barrier of dread invincible stopped him short.
I cannot believe with the monks who have told us all
things concerning witchcraft, that the treaty with
Satan was the light invention of a miser or a man in
love. On the contrary, nature and good sense alike
inform us that it was only the last resource of an overwhelming<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
despair, under the weight of dreadful outrages
and dreadful sufferings.</p>

<hr />

<p>But those great sufferings, we are told, must have been
greatly lightened about the time of St. Louis, who forbade
private wars among the nobles. My own opinion
is quite the reverse. During the fourscore or hundred
years that elapsed between his prohibition and the
wars with England (1240-1340), the great lords being
debarred from the accustomed sport of burning and
plundering their neighbours&#8217; lands, became a terror
to their own vassals. For the latter such a peace was
simply war.</p>

<p>The spiritual, the monkish lords, and others, as
shown in the <i>Journal of Eudes Rigault</i>, lately published,
make one shudder. It is a repulsive picture of
profligacy at once savage and uncontrolled. The
monkish lords especially assail the nunneries. The
austere Rigault, Archbishop of Rouen, confessor of the
holy king, conducts a personal inquiry into the state
of Normandy. Every evening he comes to a monastery.
In all of them he finds the monks leading the life of
great feudal lords, wearing arms, getting drunk, fighting
duels, keen huntsmen over all the cultivated land;
the nuns living among them in wild confusion, and
betraying everywhere the fruits of their shameless
deeds.</p>

<p>If things are so in the Church, what must the lay
lords have been? What like was the inside of those<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
dark towers which the folk below regarded with so
much horror? Two tales, undoubtedly historical,
namely, <i>Blue-Beard</i> and <i>Griselda</i>, tell us something
thereanent. To his vassals, his serfs, what indeed must
have been this devotee of torture who treated his own
family in such a way? He is known to us through the
only man who was brought to trial for such deeds; and
that not earlier than the fifteenth century,&mdash;Gilles de
Retz, who kidnapped children.</p>

<p>Sir Walter Scott&#8217;s Front de B&#339;uf, and the other
lords of melodramas and romances, are but poor creatures
in the face of these dreadful realities. The
Templar also in <i>Ivanhoe</i>, is a weak artificial conception.
The author durst not assay the foul reality of celibate
life in the Temple, or within the castle walls. Few
women were taken in there, being accounted not worth
their keep. The romances of chivalry altogether belie
the truth. It is remarkable, indeed, how often the
literature of an age expresses the very opposite of its
manners, as, for instance, the washy theatre of eclogues
after Florian,<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> during the years of the Great Terror.</p>

<p>The rooms in these castles, in such at least as may
be seen to-day, speak more plainly than any books.
Men-at-arms, pages, footmen, crammed together of
nights under low-vaulted roofs, in the daytime kept on
the battlements, on narrow terraces, in a state of most
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>sickening weariness, lived only in their pranks down
below; in feats no longer of arms on the neighbouring
domains, but of hunting, ay, and hunting of men;
insults, I may say, without number, outrages untold on
families of serfs. The lord himself well knew that
such an army of men, without women, could only be
kept in order by letting them loose from time to time.</p>

<p>The awful idea of a hell wherein God employs the
very guiltiest of the wicked spirits to torture the less
guilty delivered over to them for their sport,&mdash;this
lovely dogma of the Middle Ages was exemplified to
the last letter. Men felt that God was not among
them. Each new raid betokened more and more
clearly the kingdom of Satan, until men came to believe
that thenceforth their prayers should be offered to
him alone.</p>

<p>Up in the castle there was laughing and joking.
&#8220;The women-serfs were too ugly.&#8221; There is no question
raised as to their beauty. The great pleasure lay
in deeds of outrage, in striking and making them
weep. Even in the seventeenth century the great
ladies died with laughing, when the Duke of Lorraine
told them how, in peaceful villages, his people went
about harrying and torturing all the women, even to
the old.</p>

<p>These outrages fell most frequently, as we might
suppose, on families well to do and comparatively distinguished
among the serfs; the families, namely, of
those serf-born mayors, who already in the twelfth
century appear at the head of the village. By the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
nobles they were hated, jeered, cruelly plagued. Their
newborn moral dignity was not to be forgiven. Their
wives and daughters were not allowed to be good and
wise: they had no right to be held in any respect.
Their honour was not their own. <i>Serfs of the body</i>,
such was the cruel phrase cast for ever in their teeth.</p>

<hr />

<p>In days to come people will be slow to believe, that
the law among Christian nations went beyond anything
decreed concerning the olden slavery; that it
wrote down as an actual right the most grievous outrage
that could ever wound man&#8217;s heart. The lord
spiritual had this foul privilege no less than the lord
temporal. In a parish outside Bourges, the parson, as
being a lord, expressly claimed the firstfruits of the
bride, but was willing to sell his rights to the husband.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>It has been too readily believed that this wrong was
formal, not real. But the price laid down in certain
countries for getting a dispensation, exceeded the
means of almost every peasant. In Scotland, for
instance, the demand was for &#8220;several cows:&#8221; a price
immense, impossible. So the poor young wife was at
their mercy. Besides, the Courts of B&eacute;arn openly
maintain that this right grew up naturally: &#8220;The
eldest-born of the peasant is accounted the son of his
lord, for he perchance it was who begat him.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p><p>All feudal customs, even if we pass over this, compel
the bride to go up to the castle, bearing thither the
&#8220;wedding-dish.&#8221; Surely it was a cruel thing to make
her trust herself amongst such a pack of celibate dogs,
so shameless and so ungovernable.</p>

<p>A shameful scene we may well imagine it to have
been. As the young husband is leading his bride to
the castle, fancy the laughter of cavaliers and footmen,
the frolics of the pages around the wretched poor!
But the presence of the great lady herself will check
them? Not at all. The lady in whose delicate breeding
the romances tell us to believe,<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> but who, in her husband&#8217;s
absence, ruled his men, judging, chastising,
ordaining penalties, to whom her husband himself was
bound by the fiefs she brought him,&mdash;such a lady
would be in no wise merciful, especially towards a girl-serf
who happened also to be good-looking. Since,
according to the custom of those days, she openly kept
her gentleman and her page, she would not be sorry to
sanction her own libertinism by that of her husband.</p>

<p>Nothing will she do to hinder the fun, the sport they
are making out of yon poor trembler who has come to
redeem his bride. They begin by bargaining with him;
they laugh at the pangs endured by &#8220;the miserly
peasant;&#8221; they suck the very blood and marrow of
him. Why all this fury? Because he is neatly clad;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>is honest, settled; is a man of mark in the village.
Why, indeed? Because she is pious, chaste, and pure;
because she loves him; because she is frightened and
falls a-weeping. Her sweet eyes plead for pity.</p>

<p>In vain does the poor wretch offer all he has, even
to her dowry: it is all too little. Angered at such
cruel injustice, he will say perhaps that &#8220;his neighbour
paid nothing.&#8221; The insolent fellow! he would argue
with us! Thereon they gather round him, a yelling
mob: sticks and brooms pelt upon him like hail. They
jostle him, they throw him down. &#8220;You jealous
villain, you Lent-faced villain!&#8221; they cry; &#8220;no one
takes your wife from you; you shall have her back to-night,
and to enhance the honour done you ... your
eldest child will be a baron!&#8221; Everyone looks
out of window at the absurd figure of this dead man
in wedding garments. He is followed by bursts of
laughter, and the noisy rabble, down to the lowest
scullion, give chase to the &#8220;cuckold.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<hr />

<p>The poor fellow would have burst, had he nothing to
hope for from the Devil. By himself he returns: is
the house empty as well as desolate? No, there is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>company waiting for him there: by the fireside sits
Satan.</p>

<p>But soon his bride comes back, poor wretch, all pale
and undone. Alas! alas! for her condition. At his
feet she throws herself and craves forgiveness. Then,
with a bursting heart, he flings his arms round her
neck. He weeps, he sobs, he roars, till the house
shakes again.</p>

<p>But with her comes back God. For all her suffering,
she is pure, innocent, holy still. Satan for that
nonce will get no profit: the treaty is not yet ripe.</p>

<p>Our silly Fabliaux, our absurd tales, assume with
regard to this deadly outrage and all its further issues,
that the woman sides with her oppressors against her
husband; they would have us believe that her brutal
treatment by the former makes her happy and transports
her with delight. A likely thing indeed!
Doubtless she might be seduced by rank, politeness,
elegant manners. But no pains are ever taken to that
end. Great would be the scoffing at anyone who
made true-love&#8217;s wooing towards a serf. The whole
gang of men, to the chaplain, the butler, even the
footmen, would think they honoured her by deeds of
outrage. The smallest page thought himself a great
lord, if he only seasoned his love with insolence and
blows.</p>

<hr />

<p>One day, the poor woman, having just been ill-treated
during her husband&#8217;s absence, begins weeping,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
and saying quite aloud, the while she is tying up her
long hair, &#8220;Ah, those unhappy saints of the woods,
what boots it to offer them my vows? Are they deaf,
or have they grown too old? Why have I not some
protecting spirit, strong and mighty&mdash;wicked even, if it
need be? Some such I see in stone at the church-door;
but what do they there? Why do they not go
to their proper dwelling, the castle, to carry off and
roast those sinners? Oh, who is there will give me
power and might? I would gladly give myself in
exchange. Ah, me, what is it I would give? What
have I to give on my side? Nothing is left me. Out
on this body, out on this soul, a mere cinder now!
Why, instead of this useless goblin, have I not some
spirit, great, strong, and mighty, to help me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My darling mistress! If I am small, it is your
fault; and bigger I cannot grow. And besides, if I
were very big, neither you nor your husband would
have borne with me. You would have driven me away
with your priests and your holy water. I can be strong,
however, if you please. For, mistress mine, the spirits
in themselves are neither great nor small, neither weak
nor strong. For him who wishes it, the smallest can
become a giant.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In what way?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, nothing can be simpler. To make him a
giant, you must grant him only one gift.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A lovely woman-soul.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, wicked one! What then art thou, and what
wouldst thou have?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Only what you give me every day.... Would
you be better than the lady up yonder? She has
pledged her soul to her husband and to her lover, and
yet she yields it whole to her page. I am more than a
page to you, more than a servant. In how many
matters have I not been your little handmaid! Do
not blush, nor be angry. Let me only say, that I am
all about you, and already perhaps in you. Else, how
could I know your thoughts, even those which you
hide from yourself? Who am I, then? Your little
soul, which speaks thus openly to the great one. We
are inseparable. Do you know how long I have been
with you? Some thousand years, for I belonged to your
mother, to hers, to your ancestors. I am the Spirit of
the Fireside.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tempter! What wilt thou do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, thy husband shall be rich, thyself mighty,
and men shall fear thee.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where am I? Surely thou art the demon of
hidden treasures!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why call me demon, if I do deeds of justice, of
goodness, of piety? God cannot be everywhere&mdash;He
cannot be always working. Sometimes He likes to
rest, leaving us other spirits here to carry on the
smaller husbandry, to remedy the ills which his providence
passed over, which his justice forgot to
handle.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;Of this your husband is an example. Poor, deserving
workman, he is killing himself and gaining
nought in return. Heaven has had no time to look
after him. But I, though rather jealous of him, still
love my kind host. I pity him: his strength is going,
he can bear up no longer. He will die, like your children,
already dead of misery. This winter he was ill;
what will become of him the next?&#8221;</p>

<p>Thereon, her face in her hands, she wept two, three
hours, and even more. And when she had poured out
all her tears&mdash;her bosom still throbbing hard&mdash;the
other said, &#8220;I ask nothing: only, I pray, save him.&#8221;</p>

<p>She had promised nothing, but from that hour she
became his.</p>

<h3>POSSESSION.</h3>

<p class="noind"><span class="smcap">A dreadful</span> age was the age of gold; for thus do
I call that hard time when gold first came into use.
This was in the year 1300, during the reign of that
Fair King<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> who never spake a word; the great king
who seemed to have a dumb devil, but a devil with
mighty arm, strong enough to burn the Temple, long
enough to reach Rome, and with glove of iron to deal
the first good blow at the Pope.</p>

<p>Gold thereupon becomes a great pope, a mighty
god, and not without cause. The movement began
in Europe with the Crusades: the only wealth men
cared for was that which having wings could lend
itself to their enterprise; the wealth, namely, of swift
exchanges. To strike blows afar off the king wants
nothing but gold. An army of gold, a fiscal army,
spreads over all the land. The lord, who has brought
back with him his dreams of the East, is always
longing for its wonders, for damascened armour,
carpets, spices, valuable steeds. For all such things
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>he needs gold. He pushes away with his foot the
serf who brings him corn. &#8220;That is not all; I want
gold!&#8221;</p>

<p>On that day the world was changed. Theretofore
in the midst of much evil there had always been a
harmless certainty about the tax. According as the
year was good or bad, the rent followed the course of
nature and the measure of the harvest. If the lord
said, &#8220;This is little,&#8221; he was answered, &#8220;My lord,
Heaven has granted us no more.&#8221;</p>

<p>But the gold, alas! where shall we find it? We
have no army to seize it in the towns of Flanders.
Where shall we dig the ground to win him his treasure?
Oh, that the spirit of hidden treasures would be
our guide!<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>
<p>While all are desperate, the woman with the goblin
is already seated on her sacks of corn in the little
neighbouring village. She is alone, the rest being
still at their debate in the village.</p>

<p>She sells at her own price. But even when the
rest come up, everything favours her, some strange
magical allurement working on her side. No one
bargains with her. Her husband, before his time,
brings his rent in good sounding coin to the feudal
elm. &#8220;Amazing!&#8221; they all say, &#8220;but the Devil
is in her!&#8221;</p>

<p>They laugh, but she does not. She is sorrowful
and afraid. In vain she tries to pray that night.
Strange prickings disturb her slumber. Fantastic
forms appear before her. The small gentle sprite
seems to have grown imperious. He waxes bold.
She is uneasy, indignant, eager to rise. In her sleep
she groans, and feels herself dependent, saying, &#8220;No
more do I belong to myself!&#8221;</p>

<hr />

<p>&#8220;Here is a sensible countryman,&#8221; says the lord;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>&#8220;he pays beforehand! You charm me: do you know
accounts?&#8221;&mdash;&#8220;A little.&#8221;&mdash;&#8220;Well then, you shall
reckon with these folk. Every Saturday you shall
sit under the elm and receive their money. On
Sunday, before mass, you shall bring it up to the
castle.&#8221;</p>

<p>What a change in their condition! How the wife&#8217;s
heart beats when of a Saturday she sees her poor
workman, serf though he be, seated like a lordling
under the baronial shades. At first he feels giddy,
but in time accustoms himself to put on a grave
air. It is no joking matter, indeed; for the lord commands
them to show him due respect. When he has
gone up to the castle, and the jealous ones look like
laughing and designing to pay him off, &#8220;You see
that battlement,&#8221; says the lord, &#8220;the rope you
don&#8217;t see, but it is also ready. The first man who
touches him shall be set up there high and quick.&#8221;</p>

<hr />

<p>This speech is repeated from one to another; until
it has spread around these two as it were an atmosphere
of terror. Everybody doffs his hat to them,
bowing very low indeed. But when they pass by, folk
stand aloof, and get out of the way. In order to
shirk them they turn up cross roads, with backs
bended, with eyes turned carefully down. Such a
change makes them first savage, but afterwards sorrowful.
They walk alone through all the district.
The wife&#8217;s shrewdness marks the hostile scorn of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
castle, the trembling hate of those below. She feels
herself fearfully isolated between two perils. No one
to defend her but her lord, or rather the money they
pay him: but then to find that money, to spur on the
peasant&#8217;s slowness, and overcome his sluggish antagonism,
to snatch somewhat even from him who has
nothing, what hard pressure, what threats, what
cruelty, must be employed! This was never in the
goodman&#8217;s line of business. The wife brings him to
the mark by dint of much pushing: she says to him,
&#8220;Be rough; at need be cruel. Strike hard. Otherwise
you will fall short of your engagements; and
then we are undone.&#8221;</p>

<p>This suffering by day, however, is a trifle in comparison
with the tortures of the night. She seems to
have lost the power of sleeping. She gets up, walks
to and fro, and roams about the house. All is still;
and yet how the house is altered; its old innocence, its
sweet security all for ever gone! &#8220;Of what is that cat
by the hearth a-thinking, as she pretends to sleep, and
&#8217;tweenwhiles opens her green eyes upon me? The
she-goat with her long beard, looking so discreet and
ominous, knows more about it than she can tell. And
yon cow which the moon reveals by glimpses in her
stall, why does she give me such a sidelong look? All
this is surely unnatural!&#8221;</p>

<p>Shivering, she returns to her husband&#8217;s side.
&#8220;Happy man, how deep his slumber! Mine is over;
I cannot sleep, I never shall sleep again.&#8221; In time,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
however, she falls off. But oh, what suffering visits
her then! The importunate guest is beside her, demanding
and giving his orders. If one while she gets
rid of him by praying or making the sign of the cross,
anon he returns under another form. &#8220;Get back, devil!
What durst thou? I am a Christian soul. No, thou
shalt not touch me!&#8221;</p>

<p>In revenge he puts on a hundred hideous forms;
twining as an adder about her bosom, dancing as a frog
upon her stomach, anon like a bat, sharp-snouted, covering
her scared mouth with dreadful kisses. What is
it he wants? To drive her into a corner, so that
conquered and crushed at last, she may yield and utter
the word &#8220;Yes.&#8221; Still she is resolute to say &#8220;No.&#8221; Still
she is bent on braving the cruel struggles of every
night, the endless martyrdom of that wasting strife.</p>

<hr />

<p>&#8220;How far can a spirit make himself withal a body?
What reality can there be in his efforts and approaches?
Would she be sinning in the flesh, if she allowed the
intrusions of one who was always roaming about her?
Would that be sheer adultery?&#8221; Such was the sly
roundabout way in which sometimes he stayed and
weakened her resistance. &#8220;If I am only a breath, a
smoke, a thin air, as so many doctors call me, why are
you afraid, poor fearful soul, and how does it concern
your husband?&#8221;</p>

<p>It is the painful doom of the soul in these Middle
Ages, that a number of questions which to us would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
seem idle, questions of pure scholastics, disturb,
frighten, and torment it, taking the guise of visions,
sometimes of devilish debatings, of cruel dialogues
carried on within. The Devil, fierce as he shows himself
in the demoniacs, remains always a spirit throughout
the days of the Roman Empire, even in the time
of St. Martin or the fifth century. With the Barbarian
inroads he waxes barbarous, and takes to himself
a body. So great a body does he become, that he
amuses himself in breaking with stones the bell of
the convent of St. Benedict. More and more fleshly
is he made to appear, by way of frightening the plunderers
of ecclesiastical goods. People are taught to
believe that sinners will be tormented not in the spirit
only, but even bodily in the flesh; that they will suffer
material tortures, not those of ideal flames, but in very
deed such exquisite pangs as burning coals, gridirons,
and red-hot spits can awaken.</p>

<p>This conception of the torturing devils inflicting
material agonies on the souls of the dead, was a mine
of gold to the Church. The living, pierced with grief
and pity, asked themselves &#8220;if it were possible to redeem
these poor souls from one world to another; if to
these, too, might be applied such forms of expiation, by
atonement and compromise, as were practised upon
earth?&#8221; This bridge between two worlds was found
in Cluny, which from its very birth, about 900, became
at once among the wealthiest of the monastic
orders.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>So long as God Himself dealt out his punishments,
<i>making heavy his hand</i>, or striking <i>with the sword of
the Angel</i>, according to the grand old phrase, there
was much less of horror; if his hand was heavy as
that of a judge, it was still the hand of a Father. The
Angel who struck remained pure and clean as his own
sword. Far otherwise is it when the execution is done
by filthy demons, who resemble not the angel that
burned up Sodom, but the angel that first went forth
therefrom. In that place they stay, and their hell is
a kind of Sodom, wherein these spirits, fouler than the
sinners yielded into their charge, extract a horrible joy
from the tortures they are inflicting. Such was the
teaching to be found in the simple carvings hung out
at the doors of churches. By these men learned the
horrible lesson of the pleasures of pain. On pretence
of punishing, the devils wreaked upon their victims
the most outrageous whims. Truly an immoral and
most shameful idea was this, of a sham justice that
befriended the worse side, deepening its wickedness by
the present of a plaything, and corrupting the Demon
himself!</p>

<hr />

<p>Cruel times indeed! Think how dark and low a
heaven it was, how heavily it weighed on the head of
man! Fancy the poor little children from their earliest
years imbued with such awful ideas, and trembling
within their cradles! Look at the pure innocent virgin
believing herself damned for the pleasure infused in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
her by the spirit! And the wife in her marriage-bed
tortured by his attacks, withstanding him, and yet
again feeling him within her!&mdash;a fearful feeling known
to those who have suffered from t&aelig;nia. You feel in
yourself a double life; you trace the monster&#8217;s movements,
now boisterous, anon soft and waving, and
therein the more troublesome, as making you fancy
yourself on the sea. Then you rush off in wild dismay,
terrified at yourself, longing to escape, to die.</p>

<p>Even at such times as the demon was not raging
against her, the woman into whom he had once forced
his way would wander about as one burdened with
gloom. For thenceforth she had no remedy. He had
taken fast hold of her, like an impure steam. He is
the Prince of the Air, of storms, and not least of the
storms within. All this may be seen rudely but forcefully
presented under the great doorway of Strasburg
Cathedral. Heading the band of <i>Foolish Virgins</i>, the
wicked woman who lures them on to destruction is
filled, blown out by the Devil, who overflows ignobly
and passes out from under her skirts in a dark stream
of thick smoke.</p>

<p>This blowing-out is a painful feature in the <i>possession</i>;
at once her punishment and her pride. This proud
woman of Strasburg bears her belly well before her,
while her head is thrown far back. She triumphs in
her size, delights in being a monster.</p>

<p>To this, however, the woman we are following has
not yet come. But already she is puffed up with him,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
and with her new and lofty lot. The earth has ceased
to bear her. Plump and comely in these better days,
she goes down the street with head upright, and merciless
in her scorn. She is feared, hated, admired.</p>

<p>In look and bearing our village lady says, &#8220;I ought
to be the great lady herself. And what does she up
yonder, the shameless sluggard, amidst all those men,
in the absence of her lord?&#8221; And now the rivalry is
set on foot. The village, while it loathes her, is proud
thereat. &#8220;If the lady of the castle is a baroness, our
woman is a queen; and more than a queen,&mdash;we dare
not say what.&#8221; Her beauty is a dreadful, a fantastic
beauty, killing in its pride and pain. The Demon himself
is in her eyes.</p>

<hr />

<p>He has her and yet has her not. She is still <i>herself</i>,
and preserves <i>herself</i>. She belongs neither to the Demon
nor to God. The Demon may certainly invade
her, may encompass her like a fine atmosphere. And
yet he has gained nothing at all; for he has no will
thereto. She is <i>possessed</i>, <i>bedevilled</i>, and she does not
belong to the Devil. Sometimes he uses her with
dreadful cruelty, and yet gains nothing thereby. He
places a coal of fire on her breast, or within her bowels.
She jumps and writhes, but still says, &#8220;No, butcher,
I will stay as I am.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Take care! I will lash you with so cruel a
scourge of vipers, I will smite you with such a blow,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
that you will afterwards go weeping and rending the
air with your cries.&#8221;</p>

<p>The next night he will not come. In the morning&mdash;it
was Sunday&mdash;her husband went up to the castle.
He came back all undone. The lord had said: &#8220;A
brook that flows drop by drop cannot turn the mill.
You bring me a halfpenny at a time, which is good for
nought. I must set off in a fortnight. The king
marches towards Flanders, and I have not even a war-horse,
my own being lame ever since the tourney.
Get ready for business: I am in want of a hundred
pounds.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, my lord, where shall I find them?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You may sack the whole village, if you will; I am
about to give you men enough. Tell your churls, if
the money is not forthcoming they are lost men; yourself
especially&mdash;you shall die. I have had enough of
you: you have the heart of a woman; you are slack
and sluggish. You shall die&mdash;you shall pay for your
cowardice, your effeminacy. Stay; it makes but very
small difference whether you go down now, or whether
I keep you here. This is Sunday: right loudly would
the folk yonder laugh to see you dangling your legs
from my battlements.&#8221;</p>

<p>All this the unhappy man tells again to his wife;
and preparing hopelessly for death, commends his soul
to God. She being just as frightened, can neither lie
down nor sleep. What is to be done? How sorry
she is now to have sent the spirit away! If he would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
but come back! In the morning, when her husband
rises, she sinks crushed upon the bed. She has hardly
done so, when she feels on her chest a heavy weight.
Gasping for breath, she is like to choke. The weight
falls lower till it presses on her stomach, and therewithal
on her arms she feels the grasp as of two steel hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;You wanted me, and here I am. So, at last, stubborn
one, I have your soul&mdash;at last!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But oh, sir, is it mine to give away? My poor
husband! you used to love him&mdash;you said so: you
promised&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your husband! You forget. Are you sure your
thoughts were always kept upon him? Your soul! I
ask for it as a favour; but it is already mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sir,&#8221; she says&mdash;her pride once more returning
to her, even in so dire a strait&mdash;&#8220;no, sir; that soul
belongs to me, to my husband, to our marriage rites.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, incorrigible little fool! you would struggle
still, even now that you are under the goad! I have
seen your soul at all hours; I know it better than
you yourself. Day by day did I mark your first reluctances,
your pains, and your fits of despair. I saw
how disheartened you were when, in a low tone, you
said that no one could be held to an impossibility.
And then I saw you growing more resigned. You
were beaten a little, and you cried out not very loud.
As for me, I ask for your soul simply because you have
already lost it. Meanwhile, your husband is dying.
What is to be done? I am sorry for you: I have you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
in my power; but I want something more. You must
grant it frankly and of free will, or else he is a dead
man.&#8221;</p>

<p>She answered very low, in her sleep, &#8220;Ah me! my
body and my miserable flesh, you may take them to
save my husband; but my heart, never. No one has
ever had it, and I cannot give it away.&#8221;</p>

<p>So, all resignedly she waited there. And he flung
at her two words: &#8220;Keep them, and they will save
you.&#8221; Therewith she shuddered, felt within her a
horrible thrill of fire, and, uttering a loud cry, awoke
in the arms of her astonished husband, to drown him
in a flood of tears.</p>

<hr />

<p>She tore herself away by force, and got up, fearing
lest she should forget those two important words. Her
husband was alarmed; for, without looking even at
him, she darted on the wall a glance as piercing as
that of Medea. Never was she more handsome. In
her dark eye and the yellowish white around it played
such a glimmer as one durst not face&mdash;a glimmer like
the sulphurous jet of a volcano.</p>

<p>She walked straight to the town. The first word
was &#8220;<i>Green</i>.&#8221; Hanging at a tradesman&#8217;s door she beheld
a green gown&mdash;the colour of the Prince of the World&mdash;an
old gown, which as she put it on became new
and glossy. Then she walked, without asking anyone,
straight to the door of a Jew, at which she
knocked loudly. It was opened with great caution.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
The poor Jew was sitting on the ground, covered over
with ashes. &#8220;My dear, I must have a hundred
pounds.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, madam, how am I to get them? The Prince-bishop
of the town has just had my teeth drawn to
make me say where my gold lies.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> Look at my bleeding
mouth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know, I know; but I come to obtain from you
the very means of destroying your Bishop. When the
Pope gets a cuffing, the Bishop will not hold out long.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who says so?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Toledo.</i>&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p>He hung his head. She spoke and blew: within
her was her own soul and the Devil to boot. A
wondrous warmth filled the room: he himself was
aware of a kind of fiery fountain. &#8220;Madam,&#8221; said he,
looking at her from under his eyes, &#8220;poor and ruined
as I am, I had some pence still in store to sustain my
poor children.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You will not repent of it, Jew. I will swear to you
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>the <i>great oath</i> that kills whoso breaks it. What you are
about to give me, you shall receive back in a week, at an
early hour in the morning. This I swear by your <i>great
oath</i> and by mine, which is yet greater: &#8216;<i>Toledo</i>.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<hr />

<p>A year went by. She had grown round and plump;
had made herself one mass of gold. Men were
amazed at her power of charming. Every one admired
and obeyed her. By some devilish miracle the Jew
had grown so generous as to lend at the slightest
signal. By herself she maintained the castle, both
through her own credit in the town, and through the
fear inspired in the village by her rough extortion.
The all-powerful green gown floated to and fro, ever
newer and more beautiful. Her own beauty grew, as
it were, colossal with success and pride. Frightened at
a result so natural, everyone said, &#8220;At her time of
life how tall she grows!&#8221;</p>

<p>Meanwhile we have some news: the lord is coming
home. The lady, who for a long time had not dared
to come forth, lest she might meet the face of this other
woman down below, now mounted her white horse.
Surrounded by all her people, she goes to meet her
husband; she stops and salutes him.</p>

<p>And, first of all, she says, &#8220;How long I have been
looking for you! Why did you leave your faithful
wife so long a languishing widow? And yet I will
not take you in to-night, unless you grant me a boon.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ask it, ask it, fair lady,&#8221; says the gentleman
laughing; &#8220;but make haste, for I am eager to embrace
you. How beautiful you have grown!&#8221;</p>

<p>She whispered in his ear, so that no one knew what
she said. Before going up to the castle the worthy
lord dismounts by the village church, and goes in.
Under the porch, at the head of the chief people, he
beholds a lady, to whom without knowing her he offers
a low salute. With matchless pride she bears high
over the men&#8217;s heads the towering horned bonnet
(<i>hennin</i><a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>) of the period; the triumphal cap of the
Devil, as it was often called, because of the two horns
wherewith it was embellished. The real lady, blushing
at her eclipse, went out looking very small. Anon
she muttered, angrily, &#8220;There goes your serf. It is
all over: everything has changed places: the ass insults
the horse.&#8221;</p>

<p>As they are going off, a bold page, a pet of the
lady&#8217;s, draws from his girdle a well-sharpened dagger,
and with a single turn cleverly cuts the fine robe along
her loins.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> The crowd was astonished, but began to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>make it out when it saw the whole of the Baron&#8217;s
household going off in pursuit of her. Swift and
merciless about her whistled and fell the strokes of the
whip. She flies, but slowly, being already grown
somewhat heavy. She has hardly gone twenty paces
when she stumbles; her best friend having put a stone
in her way to trip her up. Amidst roars of laughter
she sprawls yelling on the ground. But the ruthless
pages flog her up again. The noble handsome greyhounds
help in the chase and bite her in the tenderest
places. At last, in sad disorder, amidst the terrible
crowd, she reaches the door of her house. It is shut.
There with hands and feet she beats away, crying,
&#8220;Quick, quick, my love, open the door for me!&#8221;
There hung she, like the hapless screech-owl whom
they nail up on a farm-house door; and still as hard as
ever rained the blows. Within the house all is deaf.
Is the husband there? Or rather, being rich and
frightened, does he dread the crowd, lest they should
sack his house?</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p><p>And now she has borne such misery, such strokes,
such sounding buffets, that she sinks down in a swoon.
On the cold stone threshold she finds herself seated,
naked, half-dead, her bleeding flesh covered with little
else than the waves of her long hair. Some one from
the castle says, &#8220;No more now! We do not want her
to die.&#8221;</p>

<p>They leave her alone, to hide herself. But in
spirit she can see the merriment going on at the
castle. The lord however, somewhat dazed, said
that he was sorry for it. But the chaplain says, in
his meek way, &#8220;If this woman is <i>bedevilled</i>, as
they say, my lord, you owe it to your good vassals,
you owe it to the whole country, to hand her over
to Holy Church. Since all that business with the
Templars and the Pope, what way the Demon is
making! Nothing but fire will do for him.&#8221;
Upon which a Dominican says, &#8220;Your reverence
has spoken right well. This devilry is a heresy
in the highest degree. The bedevilled, like the
heretic, should be burnt. Some of our good fathers,
however, do not trust themselves now even to the
fire. Wisely they desire that, before all things,
the soul may be slowly purged, tried, subdued by
fastings; that it may not be burnt in its pride,
that it shall not triumph at the stake. If you,
madam, in the greatness of your piety, of your
charity, would take the trouble to work upon this
woman, putting her for some years <i>in pace</i> in a safe<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
cell, of which you only should have the key,&mdash;by
thus keeping up the chastening process you might
be doing good to her soul, shaming the Devil, and
giving herself up meek and humble into the hands of
the Church.&#8221;</p>

but not before the thirteenth century does Satan put on a
settled shape. &#8220;<i>Compacts</i>,&#8221; says M. Maury, &#8220;are very rare
before that epoch;&#8221; and I believe him. How could they treat
with one who as yet had no real existence? Neither of the
treating parties was yet ripe for the contract. Before the will
could be reduced to the dreadful pass of selling itself for ever,
it must be made thoroughly desperate. It is not the unhappy
who falls into despair, but the truly wretched, who being quite
conscious of his misery, and having yet more to suffer, can
find no escape therefrom. The wretched in this way are the
men of the fourteenth century, from whom they ask a thing so
impossible as payments in gold. In this and the following
chapter I have touched on the circumstances, the feelings, the
growing despair, which brought about the enormity of <i>compacts</i>,
and, worse still than these, the dreadful character of the <i>Witch</i>.
If the name was freely used, the thing itself was then rare,
being no less than a marriage and a kind of priesthood. For
ease of illustration, I have joined together the details of so
delicate a scrutiny by a thread of fiction. The outward body
of it matters little. The essential point is to remember that
such things were not caused, as they try to persuade us, by
<i>human fickleness, by the inconstancy of our fallen nature, by the
chance persuasions of desire</i>. There was needed the deadly
pressure of an age of iron, of cruel needs: it was needful that
Hell itself should seem a shelter, an asylum, by contrast with
the hell below.</p></div>

in Spain were numberless. These relations with the civilized
Moors, with the Jews so learned and paramount in Spain, as
managers of the royal revenues, had given them a very high
degree of culture, and in Toledo they formed a kind of University.
In the sixteenth century, it was christianised, remodelled,
reduced to mere <i>white magic</i>. See the <i>Deposition of

which the tyrant Hagenbach drew the honourable ladies of
the chief burghers in Alsace, probably in scorn of their rich
and royal costume, all silks and gold. In my <i>Origines</i> I have
also related the strange claim made by the Lord of Pac&eacute;, in
Anjou, on the pretty (and honest) women of the neighbourhood.
They were to bring to the castle fourpence and a
chaplet of flowers, and to dance with his officers: a dangerous
trip, in which they might well fear some such affronts as those
offered by Hagenbach. They were forced to obey by the threat
of being stripped and pricked with a goad bearing the impress
of the lord&#8217;s arms.</p></div>

<h3>THE COVENANT.</h3>


<p class="noind"><span class="smcap">Nothing</span> was wanting but the victim. They knew
that to bring this woman before her was the most
charming present she could receive. Tenderly would
she have acknowledged the devotion of anyone
who would have given her so great a token of his
love, by delivering that poor bleeding body into her
hands.</p>

<p>But the prey was aware of the hunters. A few
minutes later and she would have been carried off, to
be for ever sealed up beneath the stone. Wrapping
herself in some rags found by chance in the stable,
she took to herself wings of some kind, and before
midnight gained some out-of-the-way spot on a lonely
moor all covered with briars and thistles. It was on
the skirts of a wood, where by the uncertain light she
might gather a few acorns, to swallow them like a
beast. Ages had elapsed since evening; she was
utterly changed. Beauty and queen of the village no
more, she seemed with the change in her spirit to
have changed her postures also. Among her acorns
she squatted like a boar or a monkey. Thoughts far
from human circled within her as she heard, or seemed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
to hear the hooting of an owl, followed by a burst of
shrill laughter. She felt afraid, but perhaps it was
the merry mockbird mimicking all those sounds, according
to its wonted fashion.</p>

<p>But the laughter begins again: whence comes it?
She can see nothing. Apparently it comes from an old
oak. Distinctly, however, she hears these words: &#8220;So,
here you are at last! You have come with an ill grace;
nor would you have come now, if you had not tried
the full depth of your last need. You were fain first
to run the gauntlet of whips; to cry out and plead for
mercy, haughty as you were; to be mocked, undone,
forsaken, unsheltered even by your husband. Where
would you have been this night, if I had not been
charitable enough to show you the <i>in pace</i> getting
ready for you in the tower? Late, very late, you are
in coming to me, and only after they have called you
the <i>old woman</i>. In your youth you did not treat me
well, when I was your wee goblin, so eager to serve
you. Now take your turn, if so I wish it, to serve me
and kiss my feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;You were mine from birth through your inborn
wickedness, through those devilish charms of yours. I
was your lover, your husband. Your own has shut
his door against you: I will not shut mine. I welcome
you to my domains, my free prairies, my woods. How
am I the gainer, you may say? Could I not long
since have had you at any hour? Were you not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
invaded, possessed, filled with my flame? I changed
your blood and renewed it: not a vein in your body
where I do not flow. You know not yourself how
utterly you are mine. But our wedding has yet to be
celebrated with all the forms. I have some manners,
and feel rather scrupulous. Let us be one for everlasting.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! sir, in my present state, what should I say?
For a long, long while back have I felt, too truly felt,
that you were all my fate. With evil intent you
caressed me, loaded me with favours, and made me
rich, in order at length to cast me down. Yesterday,
when the black greyhound bit my poor naked flesh,
its teeth scorched me, and I said, &#8216;&#8217;Tis he!&#8217; At night
when that daughter of Herodias with her foul language
scared the company, somebody put them up to the promising
her my blood; and that was you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;True; but &#8217;twas I who saved you and brought you
hither. I did everything, as you have guessed. I
ruined you, and why? That I might have you all to
myself. To speak frankly, I was tired of your husband.
You took to haggling and pettifogging: far otherwise
do I go to work; I want all or none. This is why I have
moulded and drilled you, polished and ripened you, for
my own behoof. Such, you see, is my delicacy of taste.
I don&#8217;t take, as people imagine, those foolish souls who
would give themselves up at once. I prefer the choicer
spirits, who have reached a certain dainty stage of fury<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
and despair. Stop: I must let you know how pleasant
you look at this moment. You are a great beauty, a
most desirable soul. I have loved you ever so long, but
now I am hungering for you.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will do things on a large scale, not being one of
those husbands who reckon with their betrothed. If
you wanted only riches, you should have them in a
trice. If you wanted to be queen in the stead of Joan
of Navarre, that too, though difficult, should be done,
and the King would not lose much thereby in the
matter of pride and haughtiness. My wife is greater
than a queen. But, come, tell me what you wish.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sir, I ask only for the power of doing evil.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A delightful answer, very delightful! Have I not
cause to love you? In reality those words contain all
the law and all the prophets. Since you have made so
good a choice, all the rest shall be thrown in, over and
above. You shall learn all my secrets. You shall see
into the depths of the earth. The whole world shall
come and pour out gold at thy feet. See here, my
bride, I give you the true diamond, <i>Vengeance</i>. I
know you, rogue; I know your most hidden desires.
Ay, our hearts on that point understand each other
well! Therein at least shall I have full possession of
you. You shall behold your enemy on her knees at
your feet, begging and praying for mercy, and only too
happy to earn her release by doing whatever she has
made you do. She will burst into tears; and you will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
graciously say, <i>No</i>: whereon she will cry, &#8216;Death and
damnation!&#8217; ... Come, I will make this my special
business.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sir, I am at your service. I was thankless indeed,
for you have always heaped favours on me. I am
yours, my master, my god! None other do I desire.
Sweet are your endearments, and very mild your service.&#8221;</p>

<p>And so she worships him, tumbling on all-fours.
At first she pays him, after the forms of the Temple,
such homage as betokens the utter abandonment of
the will. Her master, the Prince of this World, the
Prince of the Winds, breathes upon her in his turn,
like an eager spirit. She receives at once the three
sacraments, in reverse order&mdash;baptism, priesthood, and
marriage. In this new Church, the exact opposite of
the other, everything must be done the wrong way.
Meekly, patiently, she endures the cruel initiation,<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>
borne up by that one word, &#8220;Vengeance!&#8221;</p>

<hr />

<p>Far from being crushed or weakened by the infernal
thunderbolt, she arose with an awful vigour and flashing
eyes. The moon, which for a moment had chastely
covered herself, took flight on seeing her again. Blown
out to an amazing degree by the hellish vapour, filled
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>with fire, with fury, and with some new ineffable desire,
she grew for a while enormous with excess of fulness,
and displayed a terrible beauty. She looked around
her, and all nature was changed. The trees had gotten
a tongue, and told of things gone by. The herbs became
simples. The plants which yesterday she trod
upon as so much hay, were now as people discoursing
on the art of medicine.</p>

<p>She awoke on the morrow far, very far, from her
enemies, in a state of thorough security. She had been
sought after, but they had only found some scattered
shreds of her unlucky green gown. Had she in her
despair flung herself headlong into the torrent? Or
had she been carried off alive by the Devil? No one
could tell. Either way she was certainly damned,
which greatly consoled the lady for having failed to
find her.</p>

<p>Had they seen her they would hardly have known
her again, she was so changed. Only the eyes remained,
not brilliant, but armed with a very strange
and a rather deterring glimmer. She herself was afraid
of frightening: she never lowered them, but looked
sideways, so that the full force of their beams might
be lost by slanting them. From the sudden browning
of her hue people would have said that she had passed
through the flame. But the more watchful felt that
the flame was rather in herself, that she bore about her
an impure and scorching heat. The fiery dart with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
which Satan had pierced her was still there, and, as
through a baleful lamp, shot forth a wild, but fearfully
witching sheen. Shrinking from her, you would
yet stand still, with a strange trouble filling your every
sense.</p>

<p>She saw herself at the mouth of one of those troglodyte
caves, such as you find without number in
the hills of the Centre and the West of France. It
was in the borderland, then wild, between the country
of Merlin and the country of Melusina. Some moors
stretching out of sight still bear witness to the ancient
wars, the unceasing havoc, the many horrors, which
prevented the country being peopled again. There the
Devil was in his home. Of the few inhabitants most
were his zealous worshippers. Whatever attractions he
might have found in the rough brakes of Lorraine, the
black pine-forests of the Jura, or the briny deserts of
Burgos, his preferences lay, perhaps, in our western
marches. There might be found not only the visionary
shepherd, that Satanic union of the goat and the goatherd,
but also a closer conspiracy with nature, a deeper
insight into remedies and poisons, a mysterious connection,
whose links we know not, with Toledo the
learned, the University of the Devil.</p>

<p>The winter was setting in: its breath having first
stripped the trees, had heaped together the leaves and
small boughs of dead wood. All this she found prepared
for her at the mouth of her gloomy den. By a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
wood and moor, half a mile across, you came down
within reach of some villages, which had grown up
beside a watercourse. &#8220;Behold your kingdom!&#8221; said
the voice within her. &#8220;To-day a beggar, to-morrow
you shall be queen of the whole land.&#8221;</p>

<h3>THE KING OF THE DEAD.</h3>


<p class="noind"><span class="smcap">At</span> first she was not much affected by promises like
these. A lonely hermitage without God, amidst the
great monotonous breezes of the West, amidst memories
all the more ruthless for that mighty solitude,
of such heavy losses, such sharp affronts; a widowhood
so hard and sudden, away from the husband who had
left her to her shame&mdash;all this was enough to bow her
down. Plaything of fate, she seemed like the wretched
weed upon the moor, having no root, but tossed to and
fro, lashed and cruelly cut by the north-east winds; or
rather, perhaps, like the grey, many-cornered coral,
which only sticks fast to get more easily broken. The
children trampled on her; the people said, with a
laugh, &#8220;She is the bride of the winds.&#8221;</p>

<p>Wildly she laughed at herself when she thought on
the comparison. But, from the depth of her dark
cave, she heard,&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ignorant and witless, you know not what you
say. The plant thus tossing to and fro may well look
down upon the rank and vulgar herbs. If it tosses, it
is, at least, all self-contained&mdash;itself both flower and
seed. Do thou be like it; be thine own root, and even<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
in the whirlwind thou wilt still bear thy blossom: our
own flowers for ourselves, as they come forth from the
dust of tombs and the ashes of volcanoes.</p>

<p>&#8220;To thee, first flower of Satan, do I this day grant
the knowledge of my former name, my olden power.
I was, I am, the <i>King of the Dead</i>. Ay, have I not
been sadly slandered? &#8217;Tis I who alone can make
them reappear; a boon untold, for which I surely deserved
an altar.&#8221;</p>

<hr />

<p>To pierce the future and to call up the past, to forestal
and to live again the swift-flying moments, to
enlarge the present with that which has been and that
which will be&mdash;these are the two things forbidden to
the Middle Ages; but forbidden in vain. Nature is
invincible; nothing can be gained in such a quarter.
He who thus errs is <i>a man</i>. It is not for him to be
rooted to his furrow, with eyes cast down, looking nowhere
beyond the steps he takes behind his oxen. No:
we will go forward with head upraised, looking further
and looking deeper! This earth that we measure out
with so much care, we kick our feet upon withal, and
keep ever saying to it, &#8220;What dost thou hold in thy
bowels? What secrets lie therein? Thou givest us
back the grain we entrust to thee; but not that human
seed, those beloved dead, we have lent into thy charge.
Our friends, our loves, that lie there, will they never
bud again? Oh, that we might see them, if only for
one hour, if only for one moment!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;Some day we ourselves shall reach the unknown
land, whither they have already gone. But shall we
see them again there? Shall we dwell with them?
Where are they, and what are they doing? They must
be kept very close prisoners, these dear dead of mine,
to give me not one token! And how can I make them
hear me? My father, too, whose only hope I was,
who loved me with so mighty a love, why comes he
never to me? Ah, me! on either side is bondage,
imprisonment, mutual ignorance; a dismal night,
where we look in vain for one glimmer!&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p>These everlasting thoughts of Nature, from having
in olden times been simply mournful, became in the
Middle Ages painful, bitter, weakening, and the heart
thereby grew smaller. It seems as if they had reckoned
on flattening the soul, on pressing and squeezing it down
to the compass of a bier. The burial of the serf between
four deal boards was well suited to such an end:
it haunted one with the notion of being smothered.
A person thus enclosed, if ever he returned in one&#8217;s
dreams, would no longer appear as a thin luminous
shadow encircled by a halo of Elysium, but only as
the wretched sport of some hellish griffin-cat. What
a hateful and impious idea, that my good, kind father,
my mother so revered by all, should become the plaything
of such a beast! You may laugh now, but for
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>a thousand years it was no laughing matter: they
wept bitterly. And even now the heart swells with
wrath, the very pen grates angrily upon the paper, as
one writes down these blasphemous doings.</p>

<hr />

<p>Moreover, it was surely a cruel device to transfer
the Festival of the Dead from the Spring, where antiquity
had placed it, to November. In May, where
it fell at first, they were buried among the flowers.
In March, wherein it was afterwards placed, it became
the signal for labour and the lark. The dead and the
seed of corn entered the earth together with the same
hope. But in November, when all the work is done,
the weather close and gloomy for many days to come;
when the folk return to their homes; when a man, re-seating
himself by the hearth, looks across on that
place for evermore empty&mdash;ah, me! at such a time
how great the sorrow grows! Clearly, in choosing a
moment already in itself so funereal, for the obsequies
of Nature, they feared that a man would not find
cause enough of sorrow in himself!</p>

<p>The coolest, the busiest of men, however taken up
they be with life&#8217;s distracting cares, have, at least,
their sadder moments. In the dark wintry morning,
in the night that comes on so swift to swallow us up
in its shadow, ten years, nay, twenty years hence,
strange feeble voices will rise up in your heart: &#8220;Good
morning, dear friend, &#8217;tis we! You are alive, are
working as hard as ever. So much the better! You<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
do not feel our loss so heavily, and you have learned
to do without us; but we cannot, we never can, do
without you. The ranks are closed, the gap is all but
filled. The house that was ours is full, and we have
blessed it. All is well, is better than when your father
carried you about; better than when your little girl
said, in her turn, to you, &#8216;Papa, carry me.&#8217; But, lo!
you are in tears. Enough, till we meet again!&#8221;</p>

<p>Alas, and are they gone? That wail was sweet and
piercing: but was it just? No. Let me forget myself
a thousand times rather than I should forget them!
And yet, cost what it will to say so, say it we must, that
certain traces are fading off, are already less clear to
see; that certain features are not indeed effaced, but
grown paler and more dim. A hard, a bitter, a
humbling thought it is, to find oneself so weak and
fleeting, wavering as unremembered water; to feel that
in time one loses that treasure of grief which one had
hoped to preserve for ever. Give it me back, I pray: I
am too much bounden to so rich a fountain of tears.
Trace me again, I implore you, those features I love so
well. Could you not help me at least to dream of them
by night?</p>

<hr />

<p>More than one such prayer is spoken in the month of
November. And amidst the striking of the bells and the
dropping of the leaves, they clear out of church, saying
one to another in low tones: &#8220;I say, neighbour; up there
lives a woman of whom folk speak well and ill. For<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
myself, I dare say nothing; but she has power over the
world below. She calls up the dead, and they come.
Oh, if she might&mdash;without sin, you know, without
angering God&mdash;make my friends come to me! I am
alone, as you must know, and have lost everything in
this world. But who knows what this woman is,
whether of hell or heaven? I won&#8217;t go (he is dying
of curiosity all the while); I won&#8217;t. I have no wish
to endanger my soul: besides, the wood yonder is
haunted. Many&#8217;s the time that things unfit to see
have been found on the moor. Haven&#8217;t you heard
about Jacqueline, who was there one evening looking
for one of her sheep? Well, when she returned, she
was crazy. I won&#8217;t go.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thus unknown to each other, many of the men at
least went thither. For as yet the women hardly dared
so great a risk. They remark the dangers of the road,
ask many questions of those who return therefrom.
The new Pythoness is not like her of Endor, who
raised up Samuel at the prayer of Saul. Instead of
showing you the ghosts, she gives you cabalistic words
and powerful potions to bring them back in your
dreams. Ah, how many a sorrow has recourse to
these! The grandmother herself, tottering with her
eighty years, would behold her grandson again. By
an unwonted effort, yet not without a pang of shame
at sinning on the edge of the grave, she drags herself
to the spot. She is troubled by the savage look of a
place all rough with yews and thorns, by the rude,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
dark beauty of that relentless Proserpine. Prostrate,
trembling, grovelling on the ground, the poor old
woman weeps and prays. Answer there is none. But
when she dares to lift herself up a little, she sees that
Hell itself has been a-weeping.</p>

<hr />

<p>It is simply Nature recovering herself. Proserpine
blushes self-indignantly thereat. &#8220;Degenerate soul!&#8221;
she calls herself, &#8220;why this weakness? You came
hither with the firm desire of doing nought but evil.
Is this your master&#8217;s lesson? How he will laugh
at you for this!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay! Am I not the great shepherd of the shades,
making them come and go, opening unto them the
gate of dreams? Your Dante, when he drew my likeness,
forgot my attributes. When he gave me that
useless tail, he did not see that I held the shepherd&#8217;s
staff of Osiris; that from Mercury I had inherited his
caduceus. In vain have they thought to build up an
insurmountable wall between the two worlds; I have
wings to my heels, I have flown over. By a kindly
rebellion of that slandered Spirit, of that ruthless
monster, succour has been given to those who mourned;
mothers, lovers, have found comfort. He has taken
pity on them in defiance of their new god.&#8221;</p>

<p>The scribes of the Middle Ages, being all of the
priestly class, never cared to acknowledge the deep but
silent changes of the popular mind. It is clear that
from thenceforth compassion goes over to Satan&#8217;s side.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
The Virgin herself, ideal as she is of grace, makes no
answer to such a want of the heart. Neither does the
Church, who expressly forbids the calling up of the
dead. While all books delight in keeping up either
the swinish demon of earlier times, or the griffin butcher
of the second period, Satan has changed his shape for
those who cannot write. He retains somewhat of the
ancient Pluto; but his pale nor wholly ruthless majesty,
that permitted the dead to come back, the living
once more to see the dead, passes ever more and more
into the nature of his father, or his grandfather,
Osiris, the shepherd of souls.</p>

<p>Through this one change come many others. Men
with their mouths acknowledge the hell official and
the boiling caldrons; but in their hearts do they
truly believe therein? Would it be so easy to win
these infernal favours for hearts beset with hateful traditions
of a hell of torments? The one idea neutralizes
without wholly effacing the other, and between
them grows up a vague mixed image, resembling more
and more nearly the hell of Virgil. A mighty solace
was here offered to the human heart. Blessed above
all was the relief thus given to the poor women, whom
that dreadful dogma about the punishment of their
loved dead had kept drowned in tears and inconsolable.
The whole of their lifetime had been but one long
sigh.</p>

<hr />

<p>The Sibyl was musing over her master&#8217;s words,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
when a very light step became audible. The day has
scarcely dawned: it is after Christmas, about the first
day of the new year. Over the crisp and rimy grass
approaches a small, fair woman, all a-trembling, who
has no sooner reached the spot, than she swoons and
loses her breath. Her black gown tells plainly of her
widowhood. To the piercing gaze of Medea, without
moving or speaking, she reveals all: there is no mystery
about her shrinking figure. The other says to
her with a loud voice: &#8220;You need not tell me, little
dumb creature, for you would never get to the end of
it. I will speak for you. Well, you are dying of
love!&#8221; Recovering a little, she clasps her hands
together, and sinking almost on her knees, tells everything,
making a full confession. She had suffered,
wept, prayed, and would have silently suffered on.
But these winter feasts, these family re-unions, the
ill-concealed happiness of other women who, without
pity for her, showed off their lawful loves, had driven
the burning arrow again into her heart. Alas, what
could she do? If he might but return and comfort
her for one moment! &#8220;Be it even at the cost of
my life; let me die, but only let me see him once
more!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go back to your house: shut the door carefully:
put up the shutter even against any curious neighbour.
Throw off your mourning, and put on your wedding-clothes;
place a cover for him on the table; but yet
he will not come. You will sing the song he made for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
you, and sang to you so often, but yet he will
not come. Then you shall draw out of your box
the last dress he wore, and, kissing it, say, &#8216;So
much the worse for thee if thou wilt not come!&#8217;
And presently when you have drunk this wine, bitter,
but very sleepful, you will lie down as a wedded bride.
Then assuredly he will come to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>The little creature would have been no woman, if
next morning she had not shown her joy and tenderness
by owning the miracle in whispers to her best
friend. &#8220;Say nought of it, I beg. But he himself
told me, that if I wore this gown and slept a deep sleep
every Sunday, he would return.&#8221;</p>

<p>A happiness not without some danger. Where
would the rash woman be, if the Church learned that
she was no longer a widow; that re-awakened by her
love, the spirit came to console her?</p>

<p>But strange to tell, the secret is kept. There is an
understanding among them all, to hide so sweet a
mystery. For who has no concern therein? Who
has not lost and mourned? Who would not gladly
see this bridge created between two worlds? &#8220;O
thou beneficent Witch! Blessed be thou, spirit of the
nether world!&#8221;</p>

<h3>THE PRINCE OF NATURE.</h3>


<p class="noind"><span class="smcap">Hard</span> is the long sad winter of the North-west.
Even after its departure it renews its visits, like a
drowsy sorrow which ever and again comes back and
rages afresh. One morning everything wakes up
decked with bright needles. In this cruel mocking
splendour that makes one shiver through and through,
the whole vegetable world seems turned mineral, loses
its sweet diversity, and freezes into a mass of rough
crystals.</p>

<p>The poor Sibyl, as she sits benumbed by her hearth
of leaves, scourged by the flaying north-east winds,
feels at her heart a cruel pang, for she feels herself all
alone. But that very thought again brings her relief.
With returning pride returns a vigour that warms her
heart and lights up her soul. Intent, quick, and
sharp, her sight becomes as piercing as those needles;
and the world, the cruel world that caused her suffering,
is to her transparent as glass. Anon she rejoices
over it, as over a conquest of her making.</p>

<p>For is she not a queen, a queen with courtiers of her
own? The crows have clearly some connection with
her. In grave, dignified body they come like ancient<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
augurs, to talk to her of passing things. The wolves
passing by salute her timidly with sidelong glances.
The bear, then oftener seen than now, would sometimes,
in his heavily good-natured way, seat himself
awkwardly at the threshold of her den, like a hermit
calling on a fellow-hermit, just as we often see him in
the Lives of the Desert Fathers.</p>

<p>All those birds and beasts with whom men only
made acquaintance in hunting or slaying them, were
outlawed as much as she. With all these she comes to
an understanding; for Satan as the chief outlaw,
imparts to his own the pleasures of natural freedom,
the wild delight of living in a world sufficient unto
itself.</p>

<hr />

<p>Rough freedom of loneliness, all hail! The whole
earth seems still clothed in a white shroud, held in
bondage by a load of ice, of pitiless crystals, so uniform,
sharp, and agonizing. After the year 1200
especially, the world is shut in like a transparent
tomb, wherein all things look terribly motionless, hard,
and stiff.</p>

<p>The Gothic Church has been called a &#8220;crystallization;&#8221;
and so it truly is. About 1300, architecture
gave up all its old variety of form and living fancies,
to repeat itself for evermore, to vie with the monotonous
prisms of Spitzbergen, to become the true and
awful likeness of that hard crystal city, in which a
dreadful dogma thought to bury all life away.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>But for all the props, buttresses, flying-buttresses,
that keep the monument up, one thing there is that
makes it totter. There is no loud battering from without,
but a certain softness in the very foundations,
which attacks the crystal with an imperceptible thaw.
What thing do I mean? The humble stream of warm
tears shed by a whole world, until they have become a
very sea of wailings. What do I call it? A breath of
the future, a stirring of the natural life, which shall
presently rise again in irresistible might. The fantastic
building of which more than one side is already
sinking, says, not without terror, to itself, &#8220;It is the
breath of Satan.&#8221;</p>

<p>Beneath this Hecla-glacier lies a volcano which has
no need of bursting out; a mild, slow, gentle heat,
which caresses it from below, and, calling it nearer,
says in a whisper, &#8220;Come down.&#8221;</p>

<hr />

<p>The Witch has something to laugh at, if from the
gloom she can see how utterly Dante and St. Thomas,<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>
in the bright light yonder, ignore the true position of
things. They fancy that the Devil wins his way by
cunning or by terror. They make him grotesque and
coarse, as in his childhood, when Jesus could still send
him into the herd of swine. Or else they make him
subtle as a logician of the schools, or a fault-finding
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>lawyer. If he had been no better than this compound
of beast and disputant,&mdash;if he had only lived in the
mire or on fine-drawn quibbles about nothing, he
would very soon have died of hunger.</p>

<p>People were too ready to crow over him, when he
was shewn by Bartolus<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> pleading against the woman&mdash;that
is, the Virgin&mdash;who gets him nonsuited and condemned
with costs. At that time, indeed, the very
contrary was happening on earth. By a master-stroke
of his he had won over the plaintiff herself, his fair
antagonist, the Woman; had seduced her, not indeed
by verbal pleadings, but by arguments not less real
than they were charming and irresistible. He put into
her hands the fruits of science and of nature.</p>

<p>No need for controversies, for pleas of any kind:
he simply shows himself. In the East, the new-found
Paradise, he begins to work. From that Asian world,
which men had thought to destroy, there springs forth
a peerless day-dawn, whose beams travel afar until
they pierce the deep winter of the West. There dawns
on us a world of nature and of art, accursed of the
ignorant indeed, but now at length come forward to
vanquish its late victors in a pleasant war of love and
motherly endearments. All are conquered, all rave
about it; they will have nothing but Asia herself.
With her hands full she comes to meet us. Her
tissues, shawls, her carpets so agreeably soft, so
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>wondrously harmonized, her bright and well-wrought
blades, her richly damascened arms, make us aware of
our own barbarism. Moreover, little as that may
seem, these accursed lands of the &#8220;miscreant,&#8221; ruled
by Satan, are visibly blessed with the fairest fruits of
nature, that elixir of the powers of God; with <i>the first
of vegetables</i>, coffee; with <i>the first of beasts</i>, the Arab
horse. What am I saying?&mdash;with a whole world of
treasures, silk, sugar, and a host of herbs all-powerful
to relieve the heart, to soothe and lighten our sufferings.</p>

<p>All this breaks upon our view about the year 1300.
Spain herself, whose brain is wholly fashioned out of
Moors and Jews, for all that she is again subdued by
the barbarous children of the Goth, bears witness in
behalf of those <i>miscreants</i>. Wherever the Mussulman
children of the Devil are at work, all is prosperous, the
springs well forth, the ground is covered with flowers.
A right worthy and harmless travail decks it with those
wondrous vineyards, through which men recruit themselves,
drowning all care, and seeming to drink in
draughts of very goodness and heavenly compassion.</p>

<hr />

<p>To whom does Satan bring the foaming cup of life?
In this fasting world, which has so long been fasting
from reason, what man was there strong enough to
take all this in without growing giddy, without getting
drunken and risking the loss of his wits?</p>

<p>Is there yet a brain so far from being petrified or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
crystallized by the teaching of St. Thomas, as to remain
open to the living world, to its vegetative forces?
Three magicians, Albert the Great, Roger Bacon,
Arnaud of Villeneuve,<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> by strong efforts make their
way to Nature&#8217;s secrets; but those lusty intellects lack
flexibility and popular power. Satan falls back on his
own Eve. The woman is still the most natural thing
in the world; still keeps her hold on those traits of
roguish innocence one sees in a kitten or a child of
very high spirit. Besides, she figures much better in
that world-comedy, that mighty game wherewith the
universal Proteus disports himself.</p>

<p>But being light and changeful, she is all the less
liable to be carked and hardened by pain! This woman,
whom we have seen outlawed from the world, and
rooted on her wild moor, affords a case in point. Have
we yet to learn whether, bruised and soured as she is,
with her heart full of hate, she will re-enter the natural
world and the pleasant paths of life? Assuredly her
return thither will not find her in good tune, will
happen mainly through a round of ill. In the coming
and going of the storm she is all the more scared and
violent for being so very weak.</p>

<p>When in the mild warmth of spring, from the air,
the depths of the earth, from the flowers and their
languages, a new revelation rises round her on every
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>side, she is taken dizzy at the first. Her swelling
bosom overflows. The Sibyl of science has her
tortures, like her of Cum&aelig; or of Delphi. The schoolmen
find their fun in saying, &#8220;It is the wind and
nought else that blows her out. Her lover, the Prince
of the Air, fills her with dreams and delusions, with
wind, with smoke, with emptiness.&#8221; Foolish irony!
So far from this being the true cause of her drunkenness,
it is nothing empty, it is a real, a substantial
thing, which has loaded her bosom all too quickly.</p>

<hr />

<p>Have you ever seen the agave, that hard wild African
shrub, so sharp, bitter, and tearing, with huge bristles
instead of leaves? Ten years through it loves and
dies. At length one day the amorous shoot, which
has so long been gathering in the rough thing, goes
off with a noise like gunfire, and darts skyward. And
this shoot becomes a whole tree, not less than thirty
feet high, and bristling with sad flowers.</p>

<p>Some such analogy does the gloomy Sibyl feel, when
one morning of a spring-time, late in coming, and
therefore impetuous at the last, there takes place all
around her a vast explosion of life.</p>

<p>And all things look at her, and all things bloom for
her. For every thing that has life says softly, &#8220;Whoso
understands me, I am his.&#8221;</p>

<p>What a contrast! Here is the wife of the desert
and of despair, bred up in hate and vengeance, and lo!
all these innocent things agree to smile upon her!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
The trees, soothed by the south wind, pay her gentle
homage. Each herb of the field, with its own special
virtue of scent, or remedy, or poison&mdash;very often the
three things are one&mdash;offers itself to her, saying,
&#8220;Gather me.&#8221;</p>

<p>All things are clearly in love. &#8220;Are they not
mocking me? I had been readier for hell than for
this strange festival. O spirit, art thou indeed that
spirit of dread whom once I knew, the traces of whose
cruelty I bear about me&mdash;what am I saying, and where
are my senses?&mdash;the wound of whose dealing scorches
me still?</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, no! &#8217;Tis not the spirit whom I hoped for in
my rage; &#8216;<i>he who always says, No!</i>&#8217; This other one
utters a yes of love, of drunken dizziness. What ails
him? Is he the mad, the dazed soul of life?</p>

<p>&#8220;They spoke of the great Pan as dead. But here
he is in the guise of Bacchus, of Priapus, eager with
long-delayed desire, threatening, scorching, teeming.
No, no! Be this cup far from me! Trouble only
should I drink from it,&mdash;who knows? A despair yet
sharper than my past despairs.&#8221;</p>

<p>Meanwhile wherever the woman appears, she becomes
the one great object of love. She is followed by all,
and for her sake all despise their own proper kind.
What they say about the black he-goat, her pretended
favourite, may be applied to all. The horse neighs for
her, breaking everything and putting her in danger.
The awful king of the prairie, the black bull, bellows<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
with grief, should she pass him by at a distance. And,
behold, yon bird despondingly turns away from his
hen, and with whirring wings hastes to convince the
woman of his love!</p>

<p>Such is the new tyranny of her master, who, by the
funniest hap of all, foregoes the part accredited to him
as king of the dead, to burst forth a very king of
life.</p>

<p>&#8220;No!&#8221; she says; &#8220;leave me to my hatred: I
ask for nothing more. Let me be feared and fearful!
The beauty I would have, is only that which dwells in
these black serpents of my hair, in this countenance
furrowed with grief, and the scars of thy thunderbolt.&#8221;
But the Lord of Evil replies with cunning softness:
&#8220;Oh, but you are only the more beautiful, the more
impressible, for this fiery rage of yours! Ay, call out
and curse on, beneath one and the same goad! &#8217;Tis
but one storm calling another. Swift and smooth is the
passage from wrath to pleasure.&#8221;</p>

<p>Neither her fury nor her pride would have saved her
from such allurements. But she is saved by the boundlessness
of her desire. There is nought will satisfy her.
Each kind of life for her is all too bounded, wanting in
power. Away from her, steed and bull and loving bird!
Away, ye creatures all! for one who desires the Infinite,
how weak ye are!</p>

<p>She has a woman&#8217;s longing; but for what? Even
for the whole, the great all-containing whole. Satan
did not foresee that no one creature would content her.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>That which he could not do, is done for her in some
ineffable way. Overcome by a desire so wide and
deep, a longing boundless as the sea, she falls asleep.
At such a moment, all else forgot, no touch of hate, no
thought of vengeance left in her, she slumbers on the
plain, innocent in her own despite, stretched out in
easy luxuriance like a sheep or a dove.</p>

<p>She sleeps, she dreams; a delightful dream! It
seemed as if the wondrous might of universal life had
been swallowed up within her; as if life and death and
all things thenceforth lay fast in her bowels; as if in
return for all her suffering, she was teeming at last
with Nature herself.</p>

<h3>THE DEVIL A PHYSICIAN.</h3>


<p class="noind"><span class="smcap">That</span> still and dismal scene of the Bride of Corinth,
is repeated literally from the thirteenth to the fifteenth
century. While it was yet night, just before the daybreak,
the two lovers, Man and Nature, meet again,
embrace with rapture, and, at that same moment&mdash;horrible
to tell!&mdash;behold themselves attacked by fearful
plagues. We seem still to hear the loved one saying
to her lover, &#8220;It is all over: thy hair will be white
to-morrow. I am dead, and thou too wilt die.&#8221;</p>

<p>Three dreadful blows happen in these three centuries.
In the first we have a loathsome changing of the
outer man, diseases of the skin, above all, leprosy. In
the second, the evil turns inwards, becomes a grotesque
excitement of the nerves, a fit of epileptic
dancing. Then all grows calm, but the blood is changed,
and ulcers prepare the way for syphilis, the scourge of
the fifteenth century.</p>

<hr />

<p>Among the chief diseases of the Middle Ages, so
far as one can look therein, to speak generally, had
been hunger, weakness, poverty of blood, that kind
of consumption which is visible in the sculptures of
that time. The blood was like clear water, and scrofulous<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
ailments were rife everywhere. Barring the
well-paid doctors, Jew or Arab, of the kings, the art of
medicine was practised only with, holy water at the
church door. Thither on Sundays, after the service,
would come a crowd of sick, to whom words like these
were spoken: &#8220;You have sinned and God has afflicted
you. Be thankful: so much the less will you suffer
in the next world. Resign yourselves to suffer and to
die. The Church has prayers for the dead.&#8221; Weak,
languishing, hopeless, with no desire to live, they
followed this counsel faithfully, and let life go its way.</p>

<p>A fatal discouragement, a wretched state of things,
that would have prolonged without end these ages of
lead, and debarred them from all progress! Worst of
all things is it to resign oneself so readily, to welcome
death with so much docility, to have strength for
nothing, to desire nothing. Of more worth was that
new era, that close of the Middle Ages, which at the
cost of cruel sufferings first enabled us to regain our
former energy; namely, <i>the resurrection of desire</i>.</p>

<hr />

<p>Some Arab writers have asserted that the widespread
eruption of skin-diseases which marks the thirteenth
century, was caused by the taking of certain stimulants
to re-awaken and renew the defaults of passion.
Undoubtedly the burning spices brought over from the
East, tended somewhat to such an issue. The invention
of distilling and of divers fermented drinks may
also have worked in the same direction.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>But a greater and far more general fermentation was
going on. During the sharp inward struggle between
two worlds and two spirits, a third surviving silenced
both. As the fading faith and the newborn reason
were disputing together, somebody stepping between
them caught hold of man. You ask who? A spirit
unclean and raging, the spirit of sour desires, bubbling
painfully within.</p>

<p>Debarred from all outlet, whether of bodily enjoyment,
or the free flow of soul, the sap of life thus
closely rammed together, was sure to corrupt itself.
Bereft of light, of sound, of speech, it spoke through
pains and ominous excrescences. Then happened a
new and dreadful thing. The desire put off without
being diminished, finds itself stopped short by a cruel
enchantment, a shocking metamorphosis.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> Love was
advancing blindly with open arms. It recoils groaning;
but in vain would it flee: the fire of the blood keeps
raging; the flesh eats itself away in sharp titillations,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>and sharper within rages the coal of fire, made fiercer
by despair.</p>

<p>What remedy does Christian Europe find for this
twofold ill? Death and captivity; nothing more.
When the bitter celibacy, the hopeless love, the passion
irritable and ever-goading, bring you into a morbid
state; when your blood is decomposing, then you shall
go down into an <i>In pace</i>, or build your hut in the
desert. You must live with the handbell in your hand,
that all may flee before you. &#8220;No human being must
see you: no consolation may be yours. If you come
near, &#8217;tis death.&#8221;</p>

<hr />

<p>Leprosy is the last stage, the <i>apogee</i> of this scourge;
but a thousand other ills, less hideous but still cruel,
raged everywhere. The purest and the most fair were
stricken with sad eruptions, which men regarded as sin
made visible, or the chastisement of God. Then people
did what the love of life had never made them do:
they forsook the old sacred medicine, the bootless
holy water, and went off to the Witch. From habit
and fear as well, they still repaired to church; but
thenceforth their true church was with her, on the
moor, in the forest, in the desert. To her they carried
their vows.</p>

<p>Prayers for healing, prayers for pleasure. On the
first effervescing of their heated blood, folk went to
the Sibyl, in great secrecy, at uncertain hours. &#8220;What<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
shall I do? and what is this I feel within me? I
burn: give me some lenitive. I burn: grant me that
which causes my intolerable desire.&#8221;</p>

<p>A bold, a blamable journey, for which they reproach
themselves at night. Let this new fatality be
never so urgent, this fire be never so torturing, the
Saints themselves never so powerless; still, have not
the indictment of the Templars and the proceedings of
Pope Boniface unveiled the Sodom lying hid beneath
the altar? But a wizard Pope, a friend of the Devil,
who also carried him away, effects a change in all their
ideas. Was it not with the Demon&#8217;s help that John
XXII., the son of a shoemaker, a Pope no more of
Rome, succeeded in amassing in his town of Avignon
more gold than the Emperor and all the kings? As
the Pope is, so is the bishop. Did not Guichard,
Bishop of Troyes, procure from the Devil the death of
the King&#8217;s daughters? No death we ask for&mdash;we; but
pleasant things&mdash;for life, for health, for beauty, and
for pleasure: the things of God which God refuses.
What shall we do? Might we but win them through
the grace of the <i>Prince of this World</i>!</p>

<hr />

<p>When the great and mighty doctor of the Renaissance,
Paracelsus, cast all the wise books of ancient
medicine into the fire, Latin, and Jewish, and Arabic,
all at once, he declared that he had learned none but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
the popular medicine, that of the <i>good women</i>,<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> the
<i>shepherds</i>, and the <i>headsmen</i>, the latter of whom made
often good horse-doctors and clever surgeons, resetting
bones broken or put out of joint.</p>

<p>I make no doubt but that his admirable and
masterly work on <i>The Diseases of Women</i>&mdash;the first
then written on a theme so large, so deep, so tender&mdash;came
forth from his special experience of those women
to whom others went for aid; of the witches, namely,
who always acted as the midwives: for never in those
days was a male physician admitted to the woman&#8217;s
side, to win her trust in him, to listen to her secrets.
The witches alone attended her, and became, especially
for women, the chief and only physician.</p>

<hr />

<p>What we know for surest with regard to their medicinal
practice is, that for ends the most different, alike
to stimulate and to soothe, they made use of one large
family of doubtful and very dangerous plants, called,
by reason of the services they rendered, <i>The Comforters</i>,
or Solane&aelig;.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p><p>A vast and popular family, many kinds of which
abound to excess under our feet, in the hedges, everywhere&mdash;a
family so numerous that of one kind alone
we have eight hundred varieties.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> There is nothing
easier, nothing more common, to find. But these
plants are mostly dangerous in the using. It needs
some boldness to measure out a dose, the boldness,
perhaps, of genius.</p>

<p>Let us, step by step, mount the ladder of their
powers.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> The first are simply pot-herbs, good for
food, such as the mad-apples and the tomatoes, miscalled
&#8220;love-apples.&#8221; Other, of the harmless kinds,
are sweetness and tranquillity itself, as the white mullens,
or lady&#8217;s fox-gloves, so good for fomentations.</p>

<p>Going higher up, you come on a plant already suspicious,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>which many think a poison, a plant which at
first seems like honey and afterwards tastes bitter, reminding
one of Jonathan&#8217;s saying, &#8220;I have eaten a
little honey, and therefore shall I die.&#8221; But this death
is serviceable, a dying away of pain. The &#8220;bittersweet&#8221;
should have been the first experiment of that
bold hom&#339;opathy which rose, little by little, up to the
most dangerous poisons. The slight irritation and the
tingling which it causes might point it out as a remedy
for the prevalent diseases of that time, those, namely,
of the skin.</p>

<p>The pretty maiden who found herself woefully
adorned with uncouth red patches, with pimples, or
with ringworm, would come crying for such relief. In
the case of an elder woman the hurt would be yet
more painful. The bosom, most delicate thing in nature,
with its innermost vessels forming a matchless
flower, becomes, through its injective and congestive
tendencies, the most perfect instrument for causing
pain. Sharp, ruthless, restless are the pains she suffers.
Gladly would she accept all kinds of poison.
Instead of bargaining with the Witch, she only puts
her poor hard breast between her hands.</p>

<p>From the bittersweet, too weak for such, we rise to
the dark nightshades, which have rather more effect.
For a few days the woman is soothed. Anon she
comes back weeping. &#8220;Very well, to-night you may
come again. I will fetch you something, as you wish
me; but it will be a strong poison.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>It was a heavy risk for the Witch. At that time
they never thought that poisons could act as remedies,
if applied outwardly or taken in very weak doses. The
plants they compounded together under the name of
<i>witches&#8217; herbs</i>, seemed to be but ministers of death.
Such as were found in her hands would have proved
her, in their opinion, a poisoner or a dealer in accursed
charms. A blind crowd, all the more cruel for its
growing fears, might fell her with a shower of stones,
or make her undergo the trial by water&mdash;the <i>noyade</i>.
Or even&mdash;most dreadful doom of all!&mdash;they might
drag her with a rope round her neck to the churchyard,
where a pious festival was held and the people
edified by seeing her thrown to the flames.</p>

<p>However, she runs the risk, and fetches home the
dreadful plant. The other woman comes back to her
abode by night or morning, whenever she is least afraid
of being met. But a young shepherd, who saw her
there, told the village, &#8220;If you had seen her as I did,
gliding among the rubbish of the ruined hut, looking
about her on all sides, muttering I know not what!
Oh, but she has frightened me very much! If she
had seen me, I was a lost man. She would have
changed me into a lizard, a toad, or a bat. She took
a paltry herb&mdash;the paltriest I ever saw&mdash;of a pale
sickly yellow, with red and black marks, like the
flames, as they say, of hell. The horror of the thing
is, that the whole stalk was hairy like a man, with
long, black, sticky hairs. She plucked it roughly,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
with a grunt, and suddenly I saw her no more. She
could not have run away so quick; she must have
flown. What a dreadful thing that woman is! How
dangerous to the whole country!&#8221;</p>

<p>Certainly the plant inspires dread. It is the henbane,
a cruel and dangerous poison, but a powerful
emollient, a soft sedative poultice, which melts, unbends,
lulls to sleep the pain, often taking it quite
away.</p>

<p>Another of these poisons&mdash;the Belladonna, so called,
undoubtedly, in thankful acknowledgment, had great
power in laying the convulsions that sometimes supervened
in childbirth, and added a new danger, a new
fear, to the danger and the fear of that most trying
moment. A motherly hand instilled the gentle poison,
casting the mother herself into a sleep, and smoothing
the infant&#8217;s passage, after the manner of the modern
chloroform, into the world.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<p>Belladonna cures the dancing-fits while making you
dance. A daring hom&#339;opathy this, which at first
must frighten: it is <i>medicine reversed</i>, contrary in most
things to that which alone the Christians studied,
which alone they valued, after the example of the Jews
and Arabs.</p>

<p>How did men come to this result? Undoubtedly
by the simple effect of the great Satanic principle, that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span><i>everything must be done the wrong way</i>, the very opposite
way to that followed by the holy people. These
latter have a dread of poisons. Satan uses them and
turns them into remedies. The Church thinks by
spiritual means, by sacraments and prayers, to act
even on the body. Satan, on the other hand, uses
material means to act even upon the soul, making you
drink of forgetfulness, love, reverie, and every passion.
To the blessing of the priest he opposes the magnetic
passes made by the soft hands of women, who cheat
you of your pains.</p>

<hr />

<p>By a change of system, and yet more of dress, as
in the substitution of linen for wool, the skin-diseases
lost their intensity. Leprosy abated, but seemed to
go inwards and beget deeper ills. The fourteenth century
wavered between three scourges&mdash;the epileptic
dancings, the plague, and the sores which, according
to Paracelsus, led the way to syphilis.</p>

<p>The first danger was not the least. About 1350 it
broke out in a frightful manner with the dance of St.
Guy, and was singular especially in this, that it did not
act upon each person separately. As if carried on by
one same galvanic current, the sick caught each other
by the hand, formed immense chains, and spun and
spun round till they died. The spectators, who laughed
at first, presently catching the contagion, let themselves
go, fell into the mighty current, increased the
terrible choir.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>What would have happened if the evil had held on
as long as leprosy did even in its decline?</p>

<p>It was the first step, as it were, towards epilepsy.
If that generation of sufferers had not been cured,
it would have begotten another decidedly epileptic.
What a frightful prospect! Think of Europe covered
with fools, with idiots, with raging madmen! We are
not told how the evil was treated and checked. The
remedy prescribed by most, the falling upon these
jumpers with kicks and cuffings, was entirely fitted
to increase the frenzy and turn it into downright
epilepsy.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> Doubtless there was some other remedy,
of which people were loth to speak. At the time when
witchcraft took its first great flight, the widespread
use of the <i>Solane&aelig;</i>, above all, of belladonna, vulgarized
the medicine which really checked those affections. At
the great popular gatherings of the Sabbath, of which
we shall presently speak, the <i>witches&#8217; herb</i>, mixed with
mead, beer, cider,<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> or perry (the strong drinks of the
West), set the multitude dancing a dance luxurious
indeed, but far from epileptic.</p>

<hr />

<p>But the greatest revolution caused by the witches,
the greatest step <i>the wrong way</i> against the spirit of
the Middle Ages, was what may be called the re&euml;nfeoffment
of the stomach and the digestive organs. They
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>had the boldness to say, &#8220;There is nothing foul or
unclean.&#8221; Thenceforth the study of matter was free
and boundless. Medicine became a possibility.</p>

<p>That this principle was greatly abused, we do not
deny; but the principle is none the less clear. There
is nothing foul but moral evil. In the natural world
all things are pure: nothing may be withheld from our
studious regard, nothing be forbidden by an idle spiritualism,
still less by a silly disgust.</p>

<p>It was here especially that the Middle Ages showed
themselves in their true light, as <i>anti-natural</i>, out of
Nature&#8217;s oneness drawing distinctions of castes, of
priestly orders. Not only do they count the spirit
<i>noble</i>, and the body <i>ignoble</i>; but even parts of the body
are called noble, while others are not, being evidently
plebeian. In like manner heaven is noble, and hell
is not; but why?&mdash;&#8220;Because heaven is high up.&#8221; But
in truth it is neither high nor low, being above and
beneath alike. And what is hell? Nothing at all.
Equally foolish are they about the world at large and
the smaller world of men.</p>

<p>This world is all one piece: each thing in it is attached
to all the rest. If the stomach is servant of
the brain and feeds it, the brain also works none the
less for the stomach, perpetually helping to prepare
for it the digestive <i>sugar</i>.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<hr />

<p>There was no lack of injurious treatment. The
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>witches were called filthy, indecent, shameless, immoral.
Nevertheless, their first steps on that road
may be accounted as a happy revolution in things most
moral, in charity and kindness. With a monstrous
perversion of ideas the Middle Ages viewed the flesh
in its representative, woman,&mdash;accursed since the days
of Eve&mdash;as a thing impure. The Virgin, exalted as
<i>Virgin</i> more than as <i>Our Lady</i>, far from lifting up the
real woman, had caused her abasement, by setting men
on the track of a mere scholastic puritanism, where
they kept rising higher and higher in subtlety and
falsehood.</p>

<p>Woman herself ended by sharing in the hateful
prejudice and deeming herself unclean. She hid herself
at the hour of childbed. She blushed at loving
and bestowing happiness on others. Sober as she
mostly was in comparison with man, living as she
mostly did on herbs and fruits, sharing through her
diet of milk and vegetables the purity of the most innocent
breeds, she almost besought forgiveness for
being born, for living, for carrying out the conditions
of her life.</p>

<hr />

<p>The medical art of the Middle Ages busied itself
peculiarly about the man, a being noble and pure, who
alone could become a priest, alone could make God at
the altar. It also paid some attention to the beasts,
beginning indeed with them; but of children it thought
seldom: of women not at all.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>The romances, too, with their subtleties pourtray the
converse of the world. Outside the courts and highborn
adulterers, which form the chief topic of these
romances, the woman is always a poor Griselda, born
to drain the cup of suffering, to be often beaten, and
never cared for.</p>

<p>In order to mind the woman, to trample these usages
under foot, and to care for her in spite of herself, nothing
less would serve than the Devil, woman&#8217;s old ally, her
trusty friend in Paradise, and the Witch, that monster
who deals with everything the wrong way, exactly contrariwise
to that of the holier people. The poor creature
set such little store by herself. She would shrink
back, blushing, and loth to say a word. The Witch
being clever and evil-hearted, read her to the inmost
depths. Ere long she won her to speak out, drew from
her her little secret, overcame her refusals, her modest,
humble hesitations. Rather than undergo the remedy,
she was willing almost to die. But the cruel sorceress
made her live.</p>

<h3>CHARMS AND PHILTRES.</h3>


<p class="noind"><span class="smcap">Let</span> no one hastily conclude from the foregoing
chapter that I attempt to whiten, to acquit entirely,
the dismal bride of the Devil. If she often did good,
she could also do no small amount of ill. There is no
great power which is not abused. And this one had
three centuries of actual reigning, in the interlude between
two worlds, the older dying and the new struggling
painfully to begin. The Church, which in the
quarrels of the sixteenth century will regain some of
her strength, at least for fighting, in the fourteenth is
down in the mire. Look at the truthful picture drawn
by Cl&eacute;mangis. The nobles, so proudly arrayed in their
new armour, fall all the more heavily at Cr&eacute;cy, Poitiers,
Agincourt. All who survive end by being prisoners in
England. What a theme for ridicule! The citizens, the
very peasants make merry and shrug their shoulders.
This general absence of the lords gave, I fancy, no
small encouragement to the Sabbath gatherings which
had always taken place, but at this time might first
have grown into vast popular festivals.</p>

<p>How mighty the power thus wielded by Satan&#8217;s
sweetheart, who cures, foretels, divines, calls up the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
souls of the dead; who can throw a spell upon you,
turn you into a hare or wolf, enable you to find a treasure,
and, best of all, ensure your being beloved! It
is an awful power which combines all others. How
could a stormy soul, a soul most commonly gangrened,
and sometimes grown utterly wayward, have helped
employing it to wreak her hate and revenge; sometimes
even out of a mere delight in malice and uncleanness?</p>

<p>All that once was told the confessor, is now imparted
to her: not only the sins already done, but those also
which folk purpose doing. She holds each by her
shameful secret, by the avowal of her uncleanest desires.
To her they entrust both their bodily and mental ills;
the lustful heats of a blood inflamed and soured; the
ceaseless prickings of some sharp, urgent, furious
desire.</p>

<p>To her they all come: with her there is no shame.
In plain blunt words they beseech her for life, for
death, for remedies, for poisons. Thither comes a
young woman, to ask through her tears for the means
of saving her from the fruits of her sin. Thither comes
the step-mother&mdash;a common theme in the Middle Ages&mdash;to
say that the child of a former marriage eats well
and lives long. Thither comes the sorrowing wife
whose children year by year are born only to die. And
now, on the other hand, comes a youth to buy at any
cost the burning draught that shall trouble the heart
of some haughty dame, until, forgetful of the distance<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
between them, she has stooped to look upon her little
page.</p>

<hr />

<p>In these days there are but two types, two forms of
marriage, both of them extreme and outrageous.</p>

<p>The scornful heiress of a fief, who brings her husband
a crown or a broad estate, an Eleanor of Guyenne
for instance, will, under her husband&#8217;s very eyes, hold
her court of lovers, keeping herself under very slight
control. Let us leave romances and poems, to look at
the reality in its dread march onward to the unbridled
rage of the daughters of Philip the Fair, of the cruel
Isabella, who by the hands of her lovers impaled
Edward II. The insolence of the feudal women breaks
out diabolically in the triumphant two-horned bonnet
and other brazen-faced fashions.</p>

<p>But in this century, when classes are beginning to
mingle slightly, the woman of a lower rank, when she
marries a lord, has to fear the hardest trials. So says
the truthful history of the humble, the meek, the
patient Griselda. In a more popular form it becomes
the tale of <i>Blue-Beard</i>, a tale which seems to me quite
earnest and historical. The wife so often killed and
replaced by him could only have been his vassal. He
would have reckoned wholly otherwise with the daughter
or sister of a baron, who might avenge her. If I
am not misled by a specious conjecture, we must believe
that this tale is of the fourteenth century, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
not of those preceding, in which the lord would never
have deigned to take a wife below himself.</p>

<p>Specially remarkable in the moving tale of <i>Griselda</i>
is the fact, that throughout her heavy trials, she never
seeks support in being devout or in loving another.
She is evidently faithful, chaste, and pure. It never
comes into her mind to love elsewhere.</p>

<p>Of the two feudal women, the Heiress and Griselda,
it is peculiarly the first who has her household of gentlemen,
her courts of love, who shows favour to the
humblest lovers, encouraging them, delivering, as
Eleanor did, the famous sentence, soon to become quite
classical: &#8220;There can be no love between married
folk.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thereupon a secret hope, but hot and violent withal,
arises in more than one young heart. If he must give
himself to the Devil, he will rush full tilt on this
adventurous intrigue. Let the castle be never so surely
closed, one fine opening is still left for Satan. In a
game so perilous, what chance of success reveals itself?
Wisdom answers, None. But what if Satan said, Yes?</p>

<p>We must remember how great a distance feudal pride
set between the nobles themselves. Words are misleading:
one <i>cavalier</i> might be far below another.</p>

<p>The knight banneret, who brought a whole army of
vassals to his king&#8217;s side, would look with utter scorn
from one end of his long table on the poor <i>lackland</i>
knights seated at the other. How much greater his scorn
for the simple varlets, grooms, pages, &amp;c., fed upon his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
leavings! Seated at the lowermost end of the tables
close to the door, they scraped the dishes sent down to
them, often empty, from the personages seated above
beside the hearth. It never would cross the great
lord&#8217;s mind, that those below would dare to lift eyes of
fancy towards their lovely mistress, the haughty heiress
of a fief, sitting near her mother, &#8220;crowned by a
chaplet of white roses.&#8221; Whilst he bore with wondrous
patience the love of some stranger knight,
appointed by his lady to bear her colours, he would
have savagely punished the boldness of any servant
who looked so high. Of this kind was the raging
jealousy shown by the Lord of Fayel, who was stirred
to deadly wrath, not because his wife had a lover, but
because that lover was one of his household, the castellan
or simple constable of his castle of Coucy.</p>

<p>The deeper and less passable seemed the gulf between
the great heiress, lady of the manor, and the
groom or page who, barring his shirt, had nothing, not
even his coat, but what belonged to his master, the
stronger became love&#8217;s temptation to overleap that
gulf.</p>

<p>The youth was buoyed up by the very impossibility.
At length, one day that he managed to get out of the
tower, he ran off to the Witch and asked her advice.
Would a philtre serve as a spell to win her? Or, failing
that, must he make an express covenant? He never
shrank at all from the dreadful idea of yielding himself
to Satan. &#8220;We will take care for that, young<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
man: but hie thee up again; you will find some
change already.&#8221;</p>

<hr />

<p>The change, however, is in himself. He is stirred by
some ineffable hope, that escapes in spite of him from
a deep downcast eye, scored by an ever-darting flame.
Somebody, we may guess who, having eyes for him
alone, is moved to throw him, as she passes, a word of
pity. Oh, rapture! Kind Satan! Charming, adorable
Witch!</p>

<p>He cannot eat nor drink until he has been to see the
latter again. Respectfully kissing her hand, he almost
falls at her feet. Whatever she may ask him, whatever
she may bid him do, he will obey her. That moment,
if she wishes it, he will give her his golden chain, will
give her the ring upon his finger, though he had it
from a dying mother. But the Witch, in her native
malice, in her hatred of the Baron, feels an especial
comfort in dealing him a secret blow.</p>

<p>Already a vague anxiety disturbs the castle. A
dumb tempest, without lightning or thunder, broods
over it, like an electric vapour on a marsh. All is
silence, deep silence; but the lady is troubled. She
suspects that some supernatural power has been at
work. For why indeed be thus drawn to this youth,
more than to some one else, handsomer, nobler, renowned
already for deeds of arms? There is something
toward, down yonder! Has that woman cast a
spell upon her, or worked some hidden charm? The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
more she asks herself these questions, the more her
heart is troubled.</p>

<hr />

<p>The Witch has something to wreak her malice upon
at last. In the village she was a queen; but now the
castle comes to her, yields itself up to her on that side
where its pride ran the greatest risk. For us this
passion has a peculiar interest, as the rush of one soul
towards its ideal against every social harrier, against the
unjust decree of fate. To the Witch, on her side, it
holds out the deep, keen delight of humbling the lady&#8217;s
pride, and revenging perhaps her own wrongs; the
delight of serving the lord as he served his vassals, of
levying upon him, through the boldness of a mere
child, the firstfruits of his outrageous wedding-rights.
Undoubtedly, in these intrigues where the Witch had to
play her part, she often acted from a depth of levelling
hatred natural to a peasant.</p>

<p>Already it was something gained to have made the
lady stoop to love a menial. We should not be misled
by such examples as John of Saintr&eacute; and Cherubin.
The serving-boy filled the lowest offices in the household.
The footman proper did not then exist, while on
the other hand, few, if any maidservants lived in
military strongholds. Young hands did everything,
and were not disgraced thereby. The service, specially
the body-service of the lord and lady, honoured and
raised them up. Nevertheless, it often placed the
highborn page in situations sorrowful enough, prosaic,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
not to say ridiculous. The lord never distresses himself
about that. And the lady must indeed be charmed
by the Devil, not to see what every day she saw, her
well-beloved employed in servile and unsuitable tasks.</p>

<hr />

<p>In the Middle Ages the very high and the very low
are continually brought together. That which is hidden
by the poems, we can catch a glimpse of otherwhere.
With those ethereal passions, many gross things were
clearly blended.</p>

<p>All we know of the charms and philtres used by the
witches is very fantastic, not seldom marked by malice,
and recklessly mixed up with things that seem to us
the least likely to have awakened love. By these
methods they went a long way without the husband&#8217;s
perceiving in his blindness the game they made of
him.</p>

<p>These philtres were of various kinds. Some were
for exciting and troubling the senses, like the stimulants
so much abused in the East. Others were dangerous,
and often treacherous draughts to whose illusions
the body would yield itself without the will. Others
again were employed as tests when the passion was
defied, when one wished to see how far the greediness
of desire might derange the senses, making them
receive as the highest and holiest of favours, the most
disagreeable services done by the object of their love.</p>

<p>The rude way in which a castle was constructed,
with nothing in it but large halls, led to an utter<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
sacrifice of the inner life. It was long enough before
they took to building in one of the turrets a closet or
recess for meditation and the saying of prayers. The
lady was easily watched. On certain days set or
waited for, the bold youth would attempt the stroke,
recommended him by the Witch, of mingling a philtre
with her drink.</p>

<p>This, however, was a dangerous matter, not often tried.
Less difficult was it to purloin from the lady things
which escaped her notice, which she herself despised.
He would treasure up the very smallest paring of a
nail; he would gather up respectfully one or two
beautiful hairs that might fall from her comb. These
he would carry to the Witch, who often asked, as our
modern sleep-wakers do, for something very personal
and strongly redolent of the person, but obtained
without her leave; as, for instance, some threads torn
out of a garment long worn and soiled with the traces
of perspiration. With much kissing, of course, and
worshipping, the lover was fain reluctantly to throw
these treasures into the fire, with a view to gathering
up the ashes afterwards. By and by, when she came
to look at her garment, the fine lady would remark the
rent, but guessing at the cause, would only sigh and
hold her tongue. The charm had already begun to
work.</p>

<hr />

<p>Even if she hesitated from regard for her marriage-vow,
certain it is that life in a space so narrow, where<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
they were always in each other&#8217;s sight, so near and yet
so far, became a downright torment. And even when
she had once shown her weakness, still before her husband
and others equally jealous the moments of happiness
would assuredly be rare. Hence sprang many a
foolish outbreak of unsatisfied desire. The less they
came together, the more deeply they longed to do so.
A disordered fancy sought to attain that end by means
grotesque, unnatural, utterly senseless. So by way of
establishing a means of secret correspondence between
the two, the Witch had the letters of the alphabet
pricked on both their arms. If one of them wanted to
send a thought to the other, he brightened and brought
out by sucking the blood-red letters of the wished-for
word. Immediately, so it is said, the corresponding
letters bled on the other&#8217;s arm.</p>

<p>Sometimes in these mad fits they would drink each
of the other&#8217;s blood, so as to mingle their souls, it was
said, in close communion. The devouring of Coucy&#8217;s
heart, which the lady &#8220;found so good that she never
ate again,&#8221; is the most tragical instance of these
monstrous vows of loving cannibalism. But when the
absent one did not die, but only the love within him,
then the lady would seek counsel of the Witch, begging
of her the means of holding him, of bringing him
back.</p>

<p>The incantations used by the sorceress of Theocritus
and Virgil, though employed also in the Middle Ages,
were seldom of much avail. An attempt was made to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
win back the lover by a spell seemingly copied from
antiquity, by means of a cake, of a <i>confarreatio</i><a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> like
that which, both in Asia and Europe, had always been
the holiest pledge of love. But in this case it is not
the soul only, it is the flesh also they seek to bind;
there must be so true an identity established between
the two, that, dead to all other women, he shall live
only for her. It was a cruel ceremony on the woman&#8217;s
side. &#8220;No haggling, madam,&#8221; says the Witch.
Suddenly the proud dame grows obedient, even to
letting herself be stripped bare: for thus indeed it
must be.</p>

<p>What a triumph for the Witch! And if this lady
were the same as she who had once made her &#8220;run the
gauntlet,&#8221; how meet the vengeance, how dread the requital
now! But it is not enough to have stripped her
thus naked. About her loins is fastened a little shelf,
on which a small oven is set for the cooking of the cake.
&#8220;Oh, my dear, I cannot bear it longer! Make haste,
and relieve me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You must bear it, madam; you must feel the heat.
When the cake is done, he will be warmed by you,
by your flame.&#8221;</p>

<p>It is over; and now we have the cake of antiquity, of
the Indian and the Roman marriage, but spiced and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>warmed up by the lecherous spirit of the Devil. She
does not say with Virgil&#8217;s wizard,<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<p>But she takes him the cake, steeped, as it were, in the
other&#8217;s suffering, and kept warm by her love. He has
hardly bitten it when he is overtaken by an odd
emotion, by a feeling of dizziness. Then as the blood
rushes up to his heart he turns red and hot. Passion
fastens anew on him, and inextinguishable desire.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<h3>THE REBELS&#8217; COMMUNION&mdash;SABBATHS&mdash;THE BLACK
MASS.</h3>


<p class="noind"><span class="smcap">We</span> must now speak of the <i>Sabbaths</i>; a word which at
different times clearly meant quite different things.
Unhappily, we have no detailed accounts of these
gatherings earlier than the reign of Henry IV.<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> By
that time they were nothing more than a great lewd
farce carried on under the cloak of witchcraft. But
these very descriptions of a thing so greatly corrupted
are marked by certain antique touches that tell of the
successive periods and the different forms through
which it had passed.</p>

<hr />

<p>We may set out with this firm idea that, for many
centuries, the serf led the life of a wolf or a fox; that
he was <i>an animal of the night</i>, moving about, I may
say, as little as possible in the daytime, and truly
living in the night alone.</p>

<p>Still, up to the year 1000, so long as the people
made their own saints and legends, their daily life was
not to them uninteresting. Their nightly Sabbaths were
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>only a slight relic of paganism. They held in fear and
honour the Moon, so powerful over the good things of
earth. Her chief worshippers, the old women, burn
small candles to <i>Dianom</i>&mdash;the Diana of yore, whose
other names were Luna and Hecate. The Lupercal
(or wolf-man) is always following the women and
children, disguised indeed under the dark face of
ghost Hallequin (Harlequin). The Vigil of Venus was
kept as a holiday precisely on the first of May. On
Midsummer Day they kept the Sabaza by sacrificing
the he-goat of Bacchus Sabasius. In all this there was
no mockery; nothing but a harmless carnival of serfs.</p>

<p>But about the year 1000 the church is well-nigh
shut against the peasant through the difference between
his language and hers. By 1100 her services became
quite unintelligible. Of the mysteries played at the
church-doors, he has retained chiefly the comic side, the
ox and the ass, &amp;c. On these he makes Christmas
carols, which grow ever more and more burlesque,
forming a true Sabbatic literature.</p>

<hr />

<p>Are we to suppose that the great and fearful risings
of the twelfth century had no influence on these
mysteries, on this night-life of the <i>wolf</i>, the <i>game bird</i>,
the <i>wild quarry</i>. The great sacraments of rebellion
among the serfs, when they drank of each other&#8217;s
blood, or ate of the ground by way of solemn pledge,<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>
may have been celebrated at the Sabbaths. The &#8220;Marseillaise&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>of that time, sung by night rather than day,
was perhaps a Sabbatic chant:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;Nous sommes hommes commes ils sont!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tout aussi grand c&#339;ur nous avons!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tout autant souffrir nous pouvons!&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But the tombstone falls again in 1200. Seated
thereon the Pope and the King, with their enormous
weight, have sealed up man. Has he now his old life
by night? More than ever. The old pagan dances
must by this time have waxed furious. Our negroes
of the Antilles, after a dreadful day of heat and hard
work, would go and dance away some four leagues off.
So it was with the serf too. But with his dances there
must have mingled a merriment born of revenge,
satiric farces, burlesques and caricatures of the baron
and the priest: a whole literature of the night indeed,
that knew not one word of the literature of the day,
that knew little even of the burgher Fabliaux.</p>

<hr />

<p>Of such a nature were the Sabbaths before 1300.
Before they could take the startling form of open
warfare against the God of those days, much more was
needed still, and especially these two things: not only
a descending into the very depths of despair, but also
<i>an utter losing of respect for anything</i>.</p>

<p>To this pass they do not come until the fourteenth
century, under the Avignon popes, and during the
Great Schism; when the Church with two heads
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>seems no longer a church; when the king and all his
nobles, being in shameful captivity to the English, are
extorting the means of ransom from their oppressed
and outraged people. Then do the Sabbaths take the
grand and horrible form of the <i>Black Mass</i>, of a
ritual upside down, in which Jesus is defied and
bidden to thunder on the people if He can. In
the thirteenth century this devilish drama was still
impossible, through the horror it would have caused.
And later again, in the fifteenth, when everything,
even suffering itself, had become exhausted, so fierce
an outburst could not have issued forth; so monstrous
an invention no one would have essayed. It could only
have belonged to the age of Dante.</p>

<hr />

<p>It took place, I fancy, at one gush; an explosion as
it were of genius raving, bringing impiety up to the
height of a great popular passion-fit. To understand
the nature of these bursts of rage, we must remember
that, far from imagining the fixedness of God&#8217;s laws,
a people brought up by their own clergy to believe
and depend on miracles, had for ages past been hoping
and waiting for nothing else than a miracle which
never came. In vain they demanded one in the
desperate hour of their last worst strait. Heaven
thenceforth appeared to them as the ally of their
savage tormentors, nay, as itself a tormentor too.</p>

<p>Thereon began the <i>Black Mass</i> and the <i>Jacquerie</i>.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>
<p>In the elastic shell of the Black Mass, a thousand
variations of detail may afterwards have been inserted;
but the shell itself was strongly made and, in my
opinion, all of one piece.</p>

<p>This drama I succeeded in reproducing in my
&#8220;History of France,&#8221; in the year 1857. There
was small difficulty in casting it anew in its four
acts. Only at that time I left in it too many of the
grotesque adornments which clothed the Sabbath of a
later period; nor did I clearly enough define what
belonged to the older shell, so dark and dreadful.</p>

<hr />

<p>Its date is strongly marked by certain savage tokens
of an age accursed, and yet more by the ruling place
therein assigned to woman, a fact most characteristic
of the fourteenth century.</p>

<p>It is strange to mark how, at that period, the
woman who enjoys so little freedom still holds her
royal sway in a hundred violent fashions. At this
time she inherits fiefs, brings her kingdoms to the
king. On the lower levels she has still her throne,
and yet more in the skies. Mary has supplanted
Jesus. St. Francis and St. Dominic have seen the
three worlds in her bosom. By the immensity of her
grace she washes away sin; ay, and sometimes helps
the sinner,&mdash;as in the story of a nun whose place the
Virgin took in the choir, while she herself was gone
to meet her lover.</p>

<p>Up high, and down very low, we see the woman.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
Beatrice reigns in heaven among the stars, while John
of Meung in the <i>Romaunt of the Rose</i> is preaching the
community of women. Pure or sullied, the woman is
everywhere. We might say of her what Raymond
Lulle said of God: &#8220;What part has He in the world?
The whole.&#8221;</p>

<p>But alike in heaven and in poetry the true heroine
is not the fruitful mother decked out with children;
but the Virgin, or some barren Beatrice, who dies
young.</p>

<p>A fair English damsel passed over into France, it is
said, about the year 1300, to preach the redemption of
women. She looked on herself as their Messiah.</p>

<hr />

<p>In its earliest phase the Black Mass seemed to
betoken this redemption of Eve, so long accursed of
Christianity. The woman fills every office in the
Sabbath. She is priestess, altar, pledge of holy communion,
by turns. Nay, at bottom, is she not herself
as God?</p>

<hr />

<p>Many popular traits may be found herein, and yet
it comes not wholly from the people. The peasant
who honoured strength alone, made small account of
the woman; as we see but too clearly in our old laws
and customs. From him the woman would not have
received the high place she holds here. It is by her
own self the place is won.</p>

<p>I would gladly believe that the Sabbath in its then<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
shape was woman&#8217;s work, the work of such a desperate
woman as the Witch was then. In the fourteenth
century she saw open before her a horrible career of
torments lighted up for three or four hundred years
by the stake. After 1300 her medical knowledge is
condemned as baleful, her remedies are proscribed as
if they were poisons. The harmless drawing of lots,
by which lepers then thought to better their luck,
brought on a massacre of those poor wretches. Pope
John XXII. ordered the burning of a bishop suspected
of Witchcraft. Under a system of such blind repression
there was just the same risk in daring little as in
daring much. Danger itself made people bolder; and
the Witch was able to dare anything.</p>

<hr />

<p>Human brotherhood, defiance of the Christian
heaven, a distorted worship of nature herself as God&mdash;such
was the purport of the Black Mass.</p>

<p>They decked an altar to the arch-rebel of serfs, <i>to
Him who had been so wronged</i>, the old outlaw, unfairly
hunted out of heaven, &#8220;the Spirit by whom earth was
made, the Master who ordained the budding of the
plants.&#8221; Such were the names of honour given him
by his worshippers, the <i>Luciferians</i>, and also, according
to a very likely opinion, by the Knights of the Temple.</p>

<p>The greatest miracle of those unhappy times is, the
greater abundance found at the nightly communion of
the brotherhood, than was to be found elsewhere by
day. By incurring some little danger the Witch levied<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
her contributions from those who were best off, and
gathered their offerings into a common fund. Charity
in a Satanic garb grew very powerful, as being a crime,
a conspiracy, a form of rebellion. People would rob
themselves of their food by day for the sake of the
common meal at night.</p>

<hr />

<p>Figure to yourself, on a broad moor, and often near
an old Celtic cromlech, at the edge of a wood, this
twofold scene: on one side a well-lit moor and a great
feast of the people; on the other, towards yon wood,
the choir of that church whose dome is heaven. What
I call the choir is a hill commanding somewhat the
surrounding country. Between these are the yellow
flames of torch-fires, and some red brasiers emitting a
fantastic smoke. At the back of all is the Witch,
dressing up her Satan, a great wooden devil, black and
shaggy. By his horns, and the goatskin near him, he
might be Bacchus; but his manly attributes make him
a Pan or a Priapus. It is a darksome figure, seen
differently by different eyes; to some suggesting only
terror, while others are touched by the proud melancholy
wherein the Eternally Banished seems absorbed.<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>

<hr />

<p>Act First. The magnificent <i>In troit</i> taken by Christendom
from antiquity, that is, from those ceremonies
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>where the people in long train streamed under the
colonnades on their way to the sanctuary, is now taken
back for himself by the elder god upon his return to
power. The <i>Lavabo</i>, likewise borrowed from the
heathen lustrations, reappears now. All this he claims
back by right of age.</p>

<p>His priestess is always called, by way of honour, the
Elder; but she would sometimes have been young.
Lancre tells of a witch of seventeen, pretty, and
horribly savage.</p>

<p>The Devil&#8217;s bride was not to be a child: she must
be at least thirty years old, with the form of a Medea,
with the beauty that comes of pain; an eye deep,
tragic, lit up by a feverish fire, with great serpent
tresses waving at their will: I refer to the torrent of
her black untamable hair. On her head, perhaps, you
may see the crown of vervein, the ivy of the tomb, the
violets of death.</p>

<p>When she has had the children taken off to their
meal, the service begins: &#8220;I will come before thine
altar; but save me, O Lord, from the faithless and
violent man (from the priest and the baron).&#8221;</p>

<p>Then come the denial of Jesus, the paying of homage
to the new master, the feudal kiss, like the greetings
of the Temple, when all was yielded without reserve,
without shame, or dignity, or even purpose; the denial
of an olden god being grossly aggravated by a seeming
preference for Satan&#8217;s back.</p>

<p>It is now his turn to consecrate his priestess. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
wooden deity receives her in the manner of an olden
Pan or Priapus. Following the old pagan form she
sits a moment upon him in token of surrender, like
the Delphian seeress on Apollo&#8217;s tripod. After receiving
the breath of his spirit, the sacrament of his
love, she purifies herself with like formal solemnity.
Thenceforth she is a living altar.</p>

<hr />

<p>The Introit over, the service is interrupted for the
feast. Contrary to the festive fashion of the nobles,
who all sit with their swords beside them, here, in this
feast of brethren, are no arms, not even a knife.</p>

<p>As a keeper of the peace, each has a woman with
him. Without a woman no one is admitted. Be she
a kinswoman or none, a wife or none; be she old or
young, a woman he must bring with him.</p>

<p>What were the drinks passed round among them?
Mead, or beer, or wine; strong cider or perry? The
last two date from the twelfth century.</p>

<p>The illusive drinks, with their dangerous admixture
of belladonna, did they already appear at that board?
Certainly not. There were children there. Besides,
an excess of commotion would have prevented the
dancing.</p>

<p>This whirling dance, the famous <i>Sabbath-round</i>, was
quite enough to complete the first stage of drunkenness.
They turned back to back, their arms behind them,
not seeing each other, but often touching each other&#8217;s
back. Gradually no one knew himself, nor whom he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
had by his side. The old wife then was old no more.
Satan had wrought a miracle. She was still a woman,
desirable, after a confused fashion beloved.</p>

<hr />

<p>Act Second. Just as the crowd, grown dizzy together,
was led, both by the attraction of the women
and by a certain vague feeling of brotherhood, to
imagine itself one body, the service was resumed at the
<i>Gloria</i>. The altar, the host, became visible. These
were represented by the woman herself. Prostrate, in
a posture of extreme abasement, her long black silky
tresses lost in the dust; she, this haughty Proserpine,
offered up herself. On her back a demon officiated,
saying the <i>Credo</i>, and making the offering.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

<p>At a later period this scene came to be immodest.
But at this time, amidst the calamities of the fourteenth
century, in the terrible days of the Black Plague, and
of so many a famine, in the days of the Jacquerie and
those hateful brigands, the Free Lances,&mdash;on a people
thus surrounded by danger, the effect was more than
serious. The whole assembly had much cause to fear
a surprise. The risk run by the Witch in this bold proceeding
was very great, even tantamount to the forfeiting
of her life. Nay, more; she braved a hell of suffering,
of torments such as may hardly be described. Torn
by pincers, and broken alive; her breasts torn out;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>her skin slowly singed, as in the case of the wizard
bishop of Cahors; her body burned limb by limb on a
small fire of red-hot coal, she was like to endure an
eternity of agony.</p>

<p>Certainly all were moved when the prayer was
spoken, the harvest-offering made, upon this devoted
creature who gave herself up so humbly. Some wheat
was offered to the <i>Spirit of the Earth</i>, who made wheat
to grow. A flight of birds, most likely from the
woman&#8217;s bosom, bore to the <i>God of Freedom</i> the
sighs and prayers of the serfs. What did they ask?
Only that we, their distant descendants, might become
free.<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

<p>What was the sacrament she divided among them?
Not the ridiculous pledge we find later in the reign of
Henry IV., but most likely that <i>confarreatio</i> which we
saw in the case of the philtres, the hallowed pledge of
love, a cake baked on her own body, on the victim who,
perhaps, to-morrow would herself be passing through
the fire. It was her life, her death, they ate there.
One sniffs already the scorching flesh.</p>

<p>Last of all they set upon her two offerings, seemingly
of flesh; two images, one of <i>the latest dead</i>, the
other of the newest-born in the district. These shared
in the special virtue assigned to her who acted as altar
and Host in one, and on these the assembly made a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>show of receiving the communion. Their Host would
thus be threefold, and always human. Under a
shadowy likeness of the Devil the people worshipped
none other than its own self.</p>

<p>The true sacrifice was now over and done. The
woman&#8217;s work was ended, when she gave herself up to
be eaten by the multitude. Rising from her former
posture, she would not withdraw from the spot until
she had proudly stated, and, as it were, confirmed the
lawfulness of her proceedings by an appeal to the
thunderbolt, by an insolent defiance of the discrowned
God.</p>

<p>In mockery of the <i>Agnus Dei</i>, and the breaking of
the Christian Host, she brought a toad dressed up, and
pulled it to pieces. Then rolling her eyes about in a
frightful way she raised them to heaven, and beheading
the toad, uttered these strange words: &#8220;Ah,
<i>Philip</i>,<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> if I had you here, you should be served in the
same manner!&#8221;</p>

<hr />

<p>No answer being outwardly given to her challenge,
no thunderbolt hurled upon her head, they imagine
that she has triumphed over the Christ. The nimble
band of demons seized their moment to astonish the
people with various small wonders which amazed and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>overawed the more credulous. The toads, quite
harmless in fact, but then accounted poisonous, were
bitten and torn between their dainty teeth. They
jumped over large fires and pans of live coal, to amuse
the crowd and make them laugh at the fires of Hell.</p>

<p>Did the people really laugh after a scene so tragical,
so very bold? I know not. Assuredly there was no
laughing on the part of her who first dared all this.
To her these fires must have seemed like those of the
nearest stake. Her business rather lay in forecasting
the future of that devilish monarchy, in creating the
Witch to be.</p>

<h3>THE SEQUEL&mdash;LOVE AND DEATH&mdash;SATAN DISAPPEARS.</h3>


<p class="noind"><span class="smcap">And</span> now the multitude is made free, is of good cheer.
For some hours the serf reigns in short-lived freedom.
His time indeed is scant enough. Already the sky is
changing, the stars are going down. Another moment,
and the cruel dawn remits him to his slavery, brings
him back again under hostile eyes, under the shadow
of the castle, beneath the shadow of the church; back
again to his monotonous toiling, to the old unending
weariness of heart, governed as it were by two bells,
whereof one keeps saying &#8220;Always,&#8221; the other
&#8220;Never.&#8221; Anon they will be seen coming each out
of his own house, heavily, humbly, with an air of calm
composure.</p>

<p>Let them at least enjoy the one short moment! Let
each of these disinherited, for once fulfil his fancy, for
once indulge his musings. What soul is there so
all unhappy, so lost to all feeling, as never to have one
good dream, one fond desire; never to say, &#8220;If this
would only happen!&#8221;</p>

<p>The only detailed accounts we have, as I said before,
are modern, belonging to a time of peace and well-doing,
when France was blooming afresh, in the latter<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
years of Henry VI., years of thriving luxury, entirely
different from that dark age when the Sabbath was first
set going.</p>

<p>No thanks to Mr. Lancre and others, if we refrain
from pourtraying the Third Act as like the Church-Fair
of Rubens, a very miscellaneous orgie, a great
burlesque ball, which allowed of every kind of union,
especially between near kindred. According to those
authors, who would make us groan with horror, the
main end of the Sabbath, the explicit doctrine taught
by Satan, was incest; and in those great gatherings,
sometimes of two thousand souls, the most startling
deeds were done before the whole world.</p>

<p>This is hard to believe; and the same writers tell of
other things which seem quite opposed to a view so
cynical. They say that people went to those meetings
only in pairs, that they sat down to the feast by twos,
that even if one person came alone, she was assigned a
young demon, who took charge of her, and did the
honours of the feast. They say, too, that jealous lovers
were not afraid to go thither in company with the
curious fair.</p>

<p>We also find that the most of them came by
families, children and all. The latter were sent off
only during the first act, not during the feast, nor the
services, nor yet while this third act was going on; a
fact which proves that some decency was observed.
Moreover, the scene was twofold. The household
groups stayed on the moor in a blaze of light. It was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
only beyond the fantastic curtain of torch-smoke that
the darker spaces, where people could roam in all
directions, began.</p>

<p>The judges, the inquisitors, for all their enmity, are
fain to allow the existence here of a general spirit of
peace and mildness. Of the three things that startle
us in the feasts of nobles, there is not one here; no
swords, no duels, no tables reeking blood. No faithless
gallantries here bring dishonour on some intimate
friend. Unknown, unneeded here, for all they say, is
the unclean brotherhood of the Temple; in the Sabbath,
woman is everything.</p>

<p>The question of incest needs explaining. All
alliances between kinsfolk, even those most allowable
in the present day, were then regarded as a crime.
The modern law, which is charity itself, understands
the heart of man and the well-being of families.<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> It
allows the widower to marry his wife&#8217;s sister, the best
mother his children could have. Above all, it allows
a man to wed his cousin, whom he knows and may
trust fully, whom he has loved perhaps from childhood,
his playfellow of old, regarded by his mother
with special favour as already the adopted of her own
heart. In the Middle Ages all this was incestuous.</p>

<p>The peasant being fondest of his own family was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>driven to despair. It was a monstrous thing for him
to marry a cousin, even in the sixth degree. It was
impossible for him to get married in his own village
where the question of kinship stood so much in his
way. He had to look for a wife elsewhere, afar off.
But in those days there was not much intercourse or
acquaintance between different places, and each hated
its own neighbours. On feast days one village would
fight another without knowing the reason why, as may
sometimes still be seen in countries never so thinly
peopled. No one durst go seek a wife in the very spot
where men had been fighting together, where he himself
would have been in great danger.</p>

<p>There was another difficulty. The lord of the young
serf forbade his marrying in the next lordship. Becoming
the serf of his wife&#8217;s lord he would have been
wholly lost to his own. Thus he was debarred by the
priest from his cousin, by the lord from a stranger;
and so it happened that many did not marry at all.</p>

<p>The result was just what they pretended to avoid.
In the Sabbath the natural sympathies sprang forth
again. There the youth found again her whom he
had known and loved at first, her whose &#8220;little husband&#8221;
he had been called at ten years old. Preferring
her as he certainly did, he paid but little heed to
canonical hindrances.</p>

<p>When we come to know the Medi&aelig;val Family better,
we give up believing the declamatory assumptions of a
general mingling together of the people forming so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
great a crowd. On the contrary, we feel that each
small group is so closely joined together, as to be
utterly barred to the entrance of a stranger.</p>

<p>The serf was not jealous towards his own kin, but
his poverty and wretchedness made him exceedingly
afraid of worsening his lot by multiplying children
whom he could not support. The priest and the lord
on their part wished to increase the number of their
serfs&mdash;wanted the woman to be always bearing; and
the strangest sermons were often delivered on this
head,<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> varied sometimes with threats and cruel reproaches.
All the more resolute was the prudence of
the man. The woman, poor creature, unable to bear
children fit to live on such conditions, bearing them
only to her sorrow, had a horror of being made big.
She never would have ventured to one of these night
festivals without being first assured, again and again,
that no woman ever came away pregnant.<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

<p>They were drawn thither by the banquet, the
dancing, the lights, the amusements; in nowise by
carnal pleasure. The last thing they cared for was to
heighten their poverty, to bring one more wretch into
the world, to give another serf to their lord.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p><p>Cruel indeed was the social system of those days.
Authority bade men marry, but rendered marriage
nearly impossible, at once by the excessive misery of
most, and the senseless cruelty of the canonical prohibitions.</p>

<p>The result was quite opposed to the purity thus
preached. Under a show of Christianity existed the
patriarchate of Asia alone.</p>

<p>Only the firstborn married. The younger brothers
and sisters worked under him and for him. In the
lonely farms of the mountains of the South, far from
all neighbours and every woman, brothers and sisters
lived together, the latter serving and in all ways belonging
to the former; a way of life analogous to that
in Genesis, to the marriages of the Parsees, to the
customs still obtaining in certain shepherd tribes of
the Himalayas.</p>

<p>The mother&#8217;s fate was still more revolting. She
could not marry her son to a kinswoman, and thus
secure to herself a kindly-affected daughter-in-law.
Her son married, if he could, a girl from a distant
village, an enemy often, whose entrance proved baneful
either to the children of a former marriage, or to the
poor mother, who was often driven away by the stranger
wife. You may not think it, but the fact is certainly
so. At the very least she was ill-used; banished from
the fireside, from the very table.</p>

<p>There is a Swiss law forbidding the removal of the
mother from her place by the chimney-corner.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>She was exceedingly afraid of her son&#8217;s marrying.
But her lot was little happier if he did not marry.
None the less servant was she of the young master of
the house, who succeeded to all his father&#8217;s rights,
even to that of beating her. This impious custom
I have seen still followed in the South: a son of
five-and-twenty chastising his mother when she got
drunk.</p>

<hr />

<p>How much greater her suffering in those days of
savagery! Then it was rather he who came back from
the feast half-drunken, hardly knowing what he was
about. But one room, but one bed, was all they had
between them. She was by no means free from fear.
He had seen his friends married, and felt soured thereat.
Thenceforth her way is marked by tears, by utter
weakness, by a woful self-surrender. Threatened by
her only God, her son, heart-broken at finding herself
in a plight so unnatural, she falls desperate. She tries
to drown all her memories in sleep. At length comes
an issue for which neither of them can fairly account,
an issue such as nowadays will often happen in the
poorer quarters of large towns, where some poor woman
is forced, frightened, perhaps beaten, into bearing
every outrage. Thus conquered, and, spite of her
scruples, far too resigned, she endured thenceforth a
pitiable bondage; a life of shame and sorrow, and
abundant anguish, growing with the yearly widening<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
difference between their several ages. The woman of
six-and-thirty might keep watch over a son of twenty
years: but at fifty, alas! or still later, where would he
be? From the great Sabbath where thronged the people
of far villages, he would be bringing home a strange
woman for his youthful mistress, a woman hard, heartless,
devoid of ruth, who would rob her of her son, her
seat by the fire, her bed, of the very house which she
herself had made.</p>

<p>To believe Lancre and others, Satan accounted the
son for praiseworthy, if he kept faithful to his mother,
thus making a virtue of a crime. If this be true, we
must assume that the woman was protected by a woman,
that the Witch sided with the mother, to defend her
hearth against a daughter-in-law who, stick in hand,
would have sent her forth to beg.</p>

<p>Lancre further maintains that &#8220;never was good
Witch, but she sprang from the love of a mother for
her son.&#8221; In this way, indeed, was born the Persian
soothsayer, the natural fruit, they say, of so hateful a
mystery; and thus the secrets of the magical art were
kept confined to one family which constantly renewed
itself.</p>

<p>An impious error led them to imitate the harmless
mystery of the husbandman, the unceasing vegetable
round whereby the corn resown in the furrow, brings
forth its corn.</p>

<p>The less monstrous unions of brother with sister, so
common in the East, and in Greece, were cold and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
rarely fruitful. They were wisely abandoned; nor
would people ever have returned to them, but for that
rebellious spirit which, being aroused by absurd restrictions,
flung itself foolishly into the opposite
extreme. Thus from unnatural laws, hatred begot
unnatural customs.</p>

<p>A cruel, an accursed time, a time big with despair!</p>

<hr />

<p>We have been long discoursing; but the dawn is
well-nigh come. In a moment the hour will strike for
the spirits to take themselves away. The Witch feels
her dismal flowers already withering on her brow.
Farewell, her royalty, perhaps her life! Where would
they be, if the day still found her there?</p>

<p>Of Satan, what shall she make? A flame, a cinder?
He asks for nothing better; knowing well, in his craftiness,
that the only way to live and to be born again,
is first to die.</p>

<p>And will he die, he who as the mighty summoner of
the dead, granted to them that mourn their only joy
on earth, the love they had lost, the dream they had
cherished? Ah, no! he is very sure to live.</p>

<p>Will he die, he that mighty spirit who, finding
Creation accurst, and Nature lying cold upon the
ground, flung thither like a dirty foster-child from off
the Church&#8217;s garment, gathered her up and placed her
on his bosom? In truth it cannot be.</p>

<p>Will he die, he the one great physician of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
Middle Ages, of a world that, falling sick, was saved
by his poisons and bidden, poor fool, to live?</p>

<p>As the gay rogue is sure of living, he dies wholly at
his ease. He shuffles out of himself, cleverly burns up
his fine goatskin, and disappears in a blaze of dawn.</p>

<p>But <i>she</i> who made Satan, who made all things, good
or ill, whose countenance was given to so many forms
of love, of devotion, and of crime,&mdash;to what end will
she come? Behold her all lonely on her waste moorland.</p>

<p>She is not, as they say, the dread of all. Many
will bless her. More than one have found her beautiful,
would sell their share in Paradise to dare be near
her. But all around her is a wide gulf. They who
admire, are none the less afraid of this all-powerful
Medea, with her fair deep eyes, and the thrilling
adders of her dark overflowing hair.</p>

<p>To her thus lonely for ever, for evermore without
love, what is there left? Nothing but the Demon
who had suddenly disappeared.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis well, good Devil, let us go. I am utterly
loath to stay here any more. Hell itself is far preferable.
Farewell to the world!&#8221;</p>

<p>She must live but a very little longer, to play out the
dreadful drama she had herself begun. Near her,
ready saddled by the obedient Satan, stood a huge
black horse, the fire darting from his eyes and nostrils.
She sprang upon him with one bound.</p>

<p>They follow her with their eyes. The good folk say<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
with alarm, &#8220;What is to become of her?&#8221; With a
frightful burst of laughter, she goes off, vanishing
swift as an arrow. They would like much to know
what becomes of the poor woman, but that they
never will.<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>

<h3>THE WITCH IN HER DECLINE&mdash;SATAN MULTIPLIED AND
MADE COMMON.</h3>


<p class="noind"><span class="smcap">The</span> Devil&#8217;s delicate fondling, the lesser Witch, begotten
of the Black Mass after the greater one&#8217;s disappearance,
came and bloomed in all her malignant
cat-like grace. This woman is quite the reverse of the
other: refined and sidelong in manner, sly and purring
demurely, quick also at setting up her back. There is
nothing of the Titan about her, to be sure. Far from
that, she is naturally base; lewd from her cradle and
full of evil daintinesses. Her whole life is the expression
of those unclean thoughts which sometimes in
a dream by night may assail him who would shrink
with horror from any such by day.</p>

<p>She who is born with such a secret in her blood,
with such instinctive mastery of evil, she who has
looked so far and so low down, will have no religion,
no respect for anything or person in the world; none
even for Satan, since he is a spirit still, while she has
a particular relish for all things material.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>In her childhood she spoiled everything. Tall and
pretty she startled all by her slovenly habits. With
her Witchcraft becomes a mysterious cooking up of
some mysterious chemistry. From an early date she
delights to handle repulsive things, to-day a drug, to-morrow
an intrigue. Among diseases and love-affairs
she is in her element. She will make a clever go-between,
a bold and skilful empiric. War will be made
against her as a fancied murderer, as a woman who
deals in poisons. And yet she has small taste for such
things, is far from murderous in her desires. Devoid
of goodness, she yet loves life, loves to work cures, to
prolong others&#8217; lives. She is dangerous in two ways:
on the one hand by selling receipts for barrenness, and
even for abortion; while on the other, her headlong
libertine fancy leads her to compass a woman&#8217;s fall
with her cursed potions, to triumph in the wicked
deeds of love.</p>

<p>Different, indeed, is this one from the other! She
is a manufacturer: the other was the ungodly one, the
demon, the great rebellion, the wife, we might almost
say, the mother of Satan; for out of her and her inward
strength he grew up. But this one is the Devil&#8217;s
daughter notwithstanding. Two things she derives
from him, her uncleanness, her love of handling life.
These are her allotted walk, in these she is quite an
artist; an artist already trading in her lore, and we
are admitted into the business.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>It was said that she would perpetuate herself by the
incest from which she sprang. But she has no need
of that: numberless little ones will she beget without
help from another. In less than fifty years, at the
opening of the fifteenth century, under Charles VI., a
mighty contagion was spread abroad. Whoever
thought he had any secrets or any receipts, whoever
fancied himself a seer, whoever dreamed and travelled
in his dreams, would call himself a pet of Satan.
Every moonstruck woman adopted the awful name of
Witch!</p>

<p>A perilous, profitable name, cast at her in their
hatred by people who alternately insult and implore
the unknown power. It is none the less accepted, nay,
is often claimed. To the children who follow her, to
the woman who, with threatening fists, hurl the name
at her like a stone, she turns round, saying proudly,
&#8220;&#8217;Tis true, you have said well!&#8221;</p>

<p>The business improves, and men are mingled in it.
Hence another fall for the art. Still the least of the
witches retains somewhat of the Sibyl. Those other
frowsy charlatans, those clownish jugglers, mole-catchers,
ratkillers, who throw spells over beasts, who
sell secrets which they have not, defiled these times
with the stench of a dismal black smoke, of fear and
foolery. Satan grows enormous, gets multiplied without
end. &#8217;Tis a poor triumph, however, for him. He
grows dull and sick at heart. Still the people keep<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
flowing towards him, bent on having no other God
than he. Himself only is to himself untrue.</p>

<hr />

<p>In spite of two or three great discoveries, the fifteenth
century is, to my thinking, none the less a century
tired out, a century of few ideas.</p>

<p>It opened right worthily with the Sabbath Royal of
St. Denis, the wild and woful ball given by Charles VI.
in the abbey so named, to commemorate the burial of
Du Guesclin, which had taken place so many years
before. For three days and nights was Sodom wallowing
among the graves. The foolish king, not yet
grown quite an idiot, compelled his royal forefathers
to share in the ball, by making their dry bones dance
in their biers. Death, becoming a go-between whether
he would or no, lent a sharp spur to the voluptuous
revel. Then broke out those unclean fashions of an
age when ladies made themselves taller by wearing the
Devil&#8217;s horned-bonnet, and gloried in dressing as if
they were all with child.<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> To this fashion they clung
for the next forty years. The younger folk on their
side, not to be behind in shamelessness, eclipsed them
in the display of naked charms. The woman wore
Satan on her forehead in the shape of a horned head-dress:
on the feet of the bachelor and the page he
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>was visible in the tapering scorpion-like tips of their
shoes. Under the mask of animals they represented
the lowest side of brute nature. The famous child
stealer, Retz, here took his first flight in villany. The
great feudal ladies, unbridled Jezebels, with less sense
of shame in them than the men, scorned all disguise
whatever; displayed themselves with face uncovered.
In their sensual rages, in their mad parade of debauchery,
the king, the whole company might see the
bottomless pit itself yawning for the life, the feeling,
the body, and the soul of each.</p>

<p>Out of such doings come forth the conquered of
Agincourt, a poor generation of effete nobles, in whose
miniatures you shiver to see the falling away of their
sorry limbs, as shown through the treacherous tightness
of their clothes.<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

<hr />

<p>Much to be pitied is the Witch who, when the great
lady came home from that royal feast, became her
bosom-counsellor and agent charged with the doing of
impossible things.</p>

<p>In her own castle, indeed, the lady is almost, if not
all alone, amidst a crowd of single men. To judge
from romances you would think she delighted in girding
herself with an array of fair girls. Far otherwise
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>are we taught by history and common sense. Eleanor
is not so silly as to match herself against Rosamond.
With all their own rakishness, those queens and great
ladies could be frightfully jealous; witness she who is
said by Henry Martin to have caused the death of a
girl admired by her husband, under the outrageous
handling of his soldiery. The power wielded by the
lady&#8217;s love depends, we repeat, on her being alone.
Whatever her age and figure, she becomes the dream
of all. The Witch takes mischievous delight in making
her abuse her goddesship, in tempting her to make
game of the men she humbles and befools. She goes
to all lengths of boldness, even treating them like very
beasts. Look at them being transformed! Down on
all fours they tumble, like fawning monkeys, absurd
bears, lewd dogs, or swine eager to follow their contemptuous
Circ&eacute;.</p>

<p>Her pity rises thereat? Nay, but she grows sick
of it all, and kicks those crawling beasts with her foot.
The thing is impure, but not heinous enough. An
absurd remedy is found for her complaint. These
others being so nought, she is to have something yet
more nought&mdash;namely, a little sweetheart. The advice
is worthy of the Witch. Love&#8217;s spark shall be lighted
before its time in some young innocent, sleeping the
pure sleep of childhood! Here you have the ugly
tale of little John of Saintr&eacute;, pink of cherubim, and
other paltry puppets of the Age of Decay.</p>

<p>Through all those pedantic embellishments and sentimental<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
moralizings, one clearly marks the vile cruelty
that lies below. The fruit was killed in the flower.
Here, in a manner, is the very &#8220;eating of children,&#8221;
which was laid so often to the Witch&#8217;s charge. Anyhow,
she drained their lives. The fair lady who
caresses one in so tender and motherly a way, what is
she but a vampire, draining the blood of the weak?
The upshot of such atrocities we may gather from
the tale itself. Saintr&eacute; becomes a perfect knight, but
so utterly frail and weak as to be dared and defied by
the lout of a peasant priest, in whom the lady, become
better advised, has seen something that will suit her
best.</p>

<hr />

<p>Such idle whimsies heighten the surfeit, the mad
rage of an empty mind. Circ&eacute; among her beasts grows
so weary and heartsick that she would be a beast herself.
She fancies herself wild, and locks herself up.
From her tower she casts an evil eye towards the
gloomy forest. She fancies herself a prisoner, and
rages like a wolf chained fast. &#8220;Let the old woman
come this moment: I want her. Run!&#8221; Two minutes
later again: &#8220;What! is she not come yet?&#8221;</p>

<p>At last she is come. &#8220;Hark you: I have a sore
longing&mdash;invincible, as you know&mdash;to choke you, to
drown you, or to give you up to the bishop, who
already claims you. You have but one way of escape,
that is, to satisfy another longing of mine by changing
me into a wolf. I feel wretchedly bored, weary of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
keeping still. I want, by night at least, to run free
about the forest. Away with stupid servants, with
dogs that stun me with their noise, with clumsy horses
that kick out and shy at a thicket.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But if you were caught, my lady&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Insolent woman! You would rather die, then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;At least you have heard the story of the woman-wolf,
whose paw was cut off.<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> But, oh! how sorry I
should be.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is my concern. I will hear nothing more,
I am in a hurry&mdash;have been barking already. What
happiness, to hunt all by myself in the clear moonlight;
by myself to fasten on the hind, or man likewise
if he comes near me; to attack the tender children,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>and, above all, to set my teeth in the women; ay, the
women, for I hate them all&mdash;not one like yourself.
Don&#8217;t start, I won&#8217;t bite you&mdash;you are not to my taste,
and besides, you have no blood in you! &#8217;Tis blood I
crave&mdash;blood!&#8221;</p>

<p>She can no longer refuse. &#8220;Nothing easier, my
lady. To-night, at nine o&#8217;clock, you will drink this.
Lock yourself up, and then turning into a wolf, while
they think you are still here, you can scour the
forest.&#8221;</p>

<p>It is done; and next morning the lady finds herself
worn out and depressed. In one night she must have
travelled some thirty leagues. She has been hunting
and slaying until she is covered with blood. But the
blood, perhaps, comes from her having torn herself
among the brambles.</p>

<p>A great triumph and danger also for her who has
wrought this miracle. From the lady, however, whose
command provoked it, she receives but a gloomy welcome.
&#8220;Witch, &#8217;tis a fearful power you have; I
should never have guessed it. But now I fear and
dread you. Good cause, indeed, they have to hate
you. A happy day will it be when you are burnt. I
can ruin you when I please. One word of mine about
last night, and my peasants would this evening whet
their scythes upon you. Out, you black-looking, hateful
old hag!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p><hr />

<p>The great folk, her patrons, launch her into strange
adventures. For what can she refuse to her terrible
protectors, when nothing but the castle saves her from
the priest, from the faggot? If the baron, on his return
from a crusade, being bent on copying the manners
of the Turks, sends for her, and orders her to
steal him a few children, what can she do? Raids
such as those grand ones in which two thousand pages
were sometimes carried off from Greek ground to enter
the seraglio, were by no means unknown to the
Christians; were known from the tenth century to the
barons of England, at a later date to the knights of
Rhodes and Malta. The famous Giles of Retz, the
only one brought to trial, was punished, not for having
stolen his small serfs, a crime not then uncommon, but
for having sacrificed them to Satan. She who actually
stole them, and was ignorant, doubtless, of their future
lot, found herself between two perils: on the one hand
the peasant&#8217;s fork and scythe; on the other, those
torments which awaited her, when recusant, within the
tower. Retz&#8217;s terrible Italian would have made nothing
of pounding her in a mortar.<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></p>

<p>On all sides the perils and the profits went together.
A position more frightfully corrupting could not have
been found. The Witches themselves did not deny the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>absurd powers imputed to them by the people. They
averred that by means of a doll stuck over with needles
they could weave their spells around whomever they
pleased, making him waste away until he died. They
averred that mandragora, torn from beneath the
gallows by the teeth of a dog, who invariably died
therefrom, enabled them to pervert the understanding;
to turn men into beasts, to give women over to idiotcy
and madness. Still more dreadful was the furious
frenzy caused by the Thorn-apple, or Datura, which
made men dance themselves to death, and go through
a thousand shameful antics, without their own knowledge
or remembrance.<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>

<hr />

<p>Hence there grew up against them a feeling of
boundless hatred, mingled with as extreme a fear.
Sprenger, who wrote the <i>Hammer for Witches</i>, relates
with horror how, in a season of snow, when all the
roads were broken up, he saw a wretched multitude,
wild with terror, and spell-bound by evils all too real,
fill up all the approaches to a little German town.
&#8220;Never,&#8221; says he, &#8220;did you behold so mighty a pilgrimage
to our Lady of Grace, or her of the wilderness.
All these people, who hobbled, crawled, and stumbled
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>among the quagmires, were on their way to the Witch,
to beseech the grace of the Devil upon themselves.
How proud and excited must the old woman have felt
at seeing so large a concourse prostrate before her
feet!&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>

dreadful fancy was not rare. They hungered and thirsted for
freedom, for savage freedom. Boguet mentions how, among
the hills of Auvergne, a hunter one night drew his sword upon
a she-wolf, but missing her, cut off her paw. She fled away
limping. He came to a neighbouring castle to seek the hospitality
of him who dwelt there. The gentleman, on seeing him,
asked if he had had good sport. By way of answer he thought
to draw out of his pouch the she-wolf&#8217;s paw; but what was his
amazement to find instead of the paw a hand, and on one of
the fingers a ring, which the gentleman recognized as belonging
to his wife! Going at once in search of her, he found her hurt
and hiding her fore-arm. To the arm which had lost its hand
he fitted that which the hunter had brought him, and the lady
was fain to own that she it was, who in the likeness of a wolf
had attacked the hunter, and afterwards saved herself by leaving
a paw on the battle-field. The husband had the cruelty to
give her up to justice, and she was burnt.</p></div>

undergo the most outrageous trials of their love. We know
that queens and ladies of rank (in Italy even to the last century)
held their court at times the most forbidding, and exacted
the most unpleasant services from their favourites. There was
nothing too mean, too repulsive, for the domestic brute&mdash;the
<i>cicisbeo</i>, the priest, the half-witted page&mdash;to undergo, in the
stupid belief that the power of a philtre increased with its
nastiness. This was sad enough when the ladies were neither
young, nor beautiful, nor witty. But what of that other astounding
fact, that a Witch, who was neither a great lady, nor
young, nor fair, but poor, and perhaps a serf, clad only in dirty
rags, could still by her malice, by the strange power of her
raging lewdness, by some bewitchingly treacherous spell,
stupefy the gravest personages, and abase them to so low a
depth? Some monks of a monastery on the Rhine, wherein,
as in many other German convents, none but a noble of four
hundred years&#8217; standing could gain admission, sorrowfully
owned to Sprenger that they had seen three of their brethren
bewitched in turn, and a fourth killed by a woman, who boldly
said, &#8220;I did it, and will do so again: they cannot escape me,
for they have eaten,&#8221; &amp;c. (Sprenger, <i>Malleus maleficarum</i>,
<i>qu&aelig;stio</i>, vii. p. 84.) &#8220;The worst of it is,&#8221; says Sprenger, &#8220;that
we have no means of punishing or examining her: <i>so she lives
still</i>.&#8221;</p></div>

<h3>THE HAMMER FOR WITCHES.</h3>


<p class="noind"><span class="smcap">The</span> witches took small care to hide their game.
Rather they boasted of it; and it was, indeed, from
their own lips that Sprenger picked up the bulk of the
tales that grace his handbook. It is a pedantic work,
marked out into the absurd divisions and subdivisions
employed by the followers of St. Thomas Aquinas;
but a work sincere withal, and frank-spoken, written
by a man so thoroughly frightened by this dreadful
duel between God and the Devil, wherein God <i>generally</i>
allows the Devil to win, that the only remedy he can
discern is to pursue the latter fire in hand, and burn
with all speed those bodies which he had chosen for his
dwelling-place.</p>

<p>Sprenger&#8217;s sole merit is the fact of his having written
a complete book, which crowns a mighty system, a
whole literature. To the old <i>Penitentiaries</i>, handbooks
of confessors for the inquisition of sin, succeeded
the <i>Directories</i> for the inquisition of heresy, the greatest
sin of all. But for Witchcraft, the greatest of all
heresies, special handbooks or directories were appointed.
Hammers for Witches, to wit. These handbooks,
continually enriched by the zeal of the Dominicans,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
attained perfection in the <i>Malleus</i> of Sprenger,
the book by which he himself was guided during his
great mission to Germany, and which for a century
after served as a guide and light for the courts of the
Inquisition.</p>

<p>How was Sprenger led to the study of these things?
He tells us that being in Rome, at a refectory where
the monks were entertaining some pilgrims, he saw
two from Bohemia; one a young priest, the other his
father. The father sighing prayed for a successful
journey. Touched with a kindly feeling Sprenger
asked him why he sorrowed. Because his son was
<i>possessed</i>: at great cost and with much trouble he had
brought him to the tomb of the saints, at Rome.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is this son of yours?&#8221; said the monk.</p>

<p>&#8220;By your side.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;At this answer I shrank back alarmed. I scanned
the young priest&#8217;s figure, and was amazed to see him
eat with so modest an air, and answer with so much
gentleness. He informed me that, on speaking somewhat
sharply to an old woman, she had laid him under
a spell, and that spell was under a tree. What tree?
The Witch steadily refused to say.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sprenger&#8217;s charity led him to take the possessed
from church to church, from relic to relic. At every
halting-place there was an exorcism, followed by furious
cries, contortions, jabbering in every language, and
gambols without number: all this before the people,
who followed the pair with shuddering admiration.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
The devils, so abundant in Germany, were scarcer
among the Italians. For some days Rome talked of
nothing else. The noise made by this affair doubtless
brought the Dominican into public notice. He studied,
collected all the <i>Mallei</i>, and other manuscript handbooks,
and became a first-rate authority in the processes
against demons. His <i>Malleus</i> was most likely
composed during the twenty years between this adventure
and the important mission entrusted to Sprenger
by Pope Innocent VIII., in 1484.</p>

<hr />

<p>For that mission to Germany a clever man was
specially needed; a man of wit and ability, who might
overcome the dislike of honest German folk for the
dark system it would be his care to introduce. In the
Low Countries Rome had suffered a rude check, which
brought the Inquisition into vogue there, and consequently
closed France against it: Toulouse alone,
as being the old Albigensian country, having endured
the Inquisition. About the year 1460 a Penitentiary<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>
of Rome, being made Dean of Arras, thought to strike
an awe-inspiring blow at the <i>Chambers of Rhetoric</i>,
literary clubs which had begun to handle religious
questions. He had one of these Rhetoricians burnt for
a wizard, and along with him some wealthy burgesses,
and even a few knights. The nobles were angry at
this near approach to themselves: the public voice was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>raised in violent outcry. The Inquisition was cursed
and spat upon, especially in France. The Parliament
of Paris roughly closed its doors upon it; and thus by
her awkwardness did Rome lose her opportunity of
establishing that Reign of Terror throughout the North.</p>

<p>About 1484 the time seemed better chosen. The
Inquisition had grown to so dreadful a height in
Spain, setting itself even above the king, that it seemed
already confirmed as a conquering institution, able to
move forward alone, to make its way everywhere, and
seize upon everything. In Germany, indeed, it was
hindered by the jealous antagonism of the spiritual
princes, who, having courts of their own, and holding
inquisitions by themselves, would never agree to accept
that of Rome. But the position of these princes
towards the popular movements by which they were
then so greatly disquieted, soon rendered them more
manageable. All along the Rhine, and throughout
Swabia, even on the eastern side towards Salzburg, the
country seemed to be undermined. At every moment
burst forth some fresh revolt of the peasantry. A vast
underground volcano, an invisible lake of fire, showed
itself, as it were, from place to place, in continual
spouts of flame. More dreaded than that of Germany,
the foreign Inquisition appeared at a most seasonable
hour for spreading terror through the country, and
crushing the rebellious spirits, by roasting, as the
wizards of to-day, those who might else have been the
insurgents of to-morrow. It was a beautiful <i>derivative</i>,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
an excellent popular weapon for putting down the
people. This time the storm got turned upon the
Wizards, as in 1349, and on many other occasions it
had been launched against the Jews.</p>

<p>Only the right man was needed. He who should
be the first to set up his judgment-seat in sight of the
jealous courts of Mentz and Cologne, in presence of
the mocking mobs of Strazburg or Frankfort, must
indeed be a man of ready wit. He would need great
personal cleverness to atone for, to cause a partial
forgetfulness of his hateful mission. Rome, too, has
always plumed herself on choosing the best men for
her work. Caring little for questions, and much for
persons, she thought rightly enough that the successful
issue of her affairs depended on the special character
of her several agents abroad. Was Sprenger the right
man? He was a German to begin with, a Dominican
enjoying beforehand the support of that dreaded order
through all its convents, through all its schools. Need
was there of a worthy son of the schools, a good disputant,
of a man well skilled in the <i>Sum</i>,<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> grounded
firm in his St. Thomas, able at any moment to quote
texts. All this Sprenger certainly was: and best of
all, he was a fool.</p>

<hr />

<p>&#8220;It has been often said that <i>diabolus</i> comes from
<i>dia</i>, &#8216;two,&#8217; and <i>bolus</i>, &#8216;a pill or ball,&#8217; because devouring
alike soul and body, he makes but one pill, one mouthful
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>of the two. But&#8221;&mdash;he goes on to say with the
gravity of <i>Sganarelle</i>&mdash;&#8220;in Greek etymology <i>diabolus</i>
means &#8216;shut up in a house of bondage,&#8217; or rather
&#8216;flowing down&#8217; (Teufel?), that is to say, falling,
because he fell from heaven.&#8221;</p>

<p>Whence comes the word sorcery (<i>mal&eacute;fice</i>)? From
<i>maleficiendo</i>, which means <i>male de fide sentiendo</i>.<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> A
curious etymology, but one that will hold a great deal.
Once trace a resemblance between witchcraft and evil
opinions, and every wizard becomes a heretic, every
doubter a wizard. All who think wrongly can be
burnt for wizards. This was done at Arras; and they
long to establish the same rule, little by little, everywhere
else.</p>

<p>Herein lies the once sure merit of Sprenger. A
fool, but a fearless one, he boldly lays down the most
unwelcome theses. Others would have striven to shirk,
to explain away, to diminish, the objections that might
be made. Not he, however. From the first page he
puts plainly forward, one by one, the natural manifest
reasons for not believing in the Satanic miracles. To
these he coldly adds: &#8220;<i>They are but so many heretical
mistakes</i>.&#8221; And without stopping to refute those
reasons, he copies you out the adverse passages found
in the Bible, St. Thomas, in books of legends, in the
canonists, and the scholiasts. Having first shown you
the right interpretation, he grinds it to powder by
dint of authority.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>
<p>He sits down satisfied, calm as a conqueror; seeming
to say, &#8220;Well, what say you now? Will you
dare use your reason again? Go and doubt away
then; doubt, for instance, that the Devil delights in
setting himself between wife and husband, although
the Church and all the canonists repeatedly admit this
reason for a divorce!&#8221;</p>

<p>Of a truth this is unanswerable: nobody will breathe
so much as a whisper in reply. Since Sprenger heads
his handbook for judges by declaring the slightest
doubt <i>heretical</i>, the judge stands bound accordingly;
he feels that he cannot stumble, that if unhappily he
should ever be tempted by an impulse of doubt or
humanity, he must begin by condemning himself and
delivering his own body to the flames.</p>

<hr />

<p>The same method prevails everywhere: first the
sensible meaning, which is then confronted openly,
without reserve, by the negation of all good sense.
Some one, for instance, might be tempted to say that
as love is in the soul, there is no need to account for it
by the mysterious working of the Devil. That is
surely specious, is it not?</p>

<p>&#8220;By no means,&#8221; says Sprenger.</p>

<p>&#8220;I mark a difference. He who cuts wood does not
cause it to burn: he only does so indirectly. The
woodcutter is Love; see Denis the Areopagite,
Origen, John of Damascus. Therefore, love is but the
indirect cause of love.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>What a thing, you see, to have studied! No weak
school could have turned out such a man. Only Paris,
Louvain, or Cologne, had machinery fit to mould the
human brain. The school of Paris was mighty: for
dog-Latin who can be matched with the <i>Janotus</i> of
Gargantua?<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> But mightier yet was Cologne, glorious
queen of darkness, whence Hutten drew the type of
his <i>Obscuri viri</i>, that thriving and fruitful race of
obscurantists and ignoramuses.<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

<p>This massive logician, so full of words, so devoid of
meaning, sworn foe of nature as well as reason, takes
his seat with a proud reliance on his books and gown,
on his dirt and dust. On one side of his judgement-table
lies the <i>Sum</i>, on the other the <i>Directory</i>. Beyond
these he never goes: at all else he only smiles.
On such a man as he there is no imposing: he is not
the man to utter anent astrology or alchemy nonsense
not so foolish but that others might be led thereby to
observe truly. And yet Sprenger is a freethinker: he
is sceptical about old receipts! Albert the Great may
aver, that some sage in a spring of water will suffice to
raise a storm, but Sprenger only shakes his head.
Sage indeed! Tell that to others, I beg. For all my
little experience, I see herein the craft of One who
would put us on the wrong scent, that cunning Prince
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>of the Air; but he will fare ill, for he has to deal
with a doctor more subtle than the Subtle One
himself.</p>

<p>I should have liked to see face to face this wonderful
specimen of a judge, and the people who were brought
before him. The creatures that God might bring
together from two different worlds would not be more
unlike, more strange to each other, more utterly wanting
in a common language. The old hag, a skeleton
in tatters, with an eye flashing forth evil things, a
being thrice cooked in hell-fire; and the ill-looking
hermit shepherd of the Black Forest or the upper
Alpine wastes&mdash;such are the savages offered to the
leaden gaze of a scholarling, to the judgement of a
schoolman.</p>

<p>Not long will they let him toil in his judgment-seat.
They will tell all without being tortured. Come the
torture will indeed, but afterwards, by way of complement
and crown to the law-procedure. They explain
and relate to order whatever they have done. The
Devil is the Witch&#8217;s bedfellow, the shepherd&#8217;s intimate
friend. She, for her part, smiles triumphantly, feels a
manifest joy in the horror of those around.</p>

<p>Truly, the old woman is very mad, and equally so
the shepherd. Are they foolish? Not at all, but far
otherwise. They are refined, subtle, skilled in growing
herbs, and seeing through walls. Still more clearly do
they see those monumental ass&#8217;s ears that overshadow
the doctor&#8217;s cap. Clearest of all is the fear he has of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
them, for in vain does he try to bear him boldly; he
does nought but tremble. He himself owns that, if
the priest who adjures the demon does not take care,
the Devil will change his lodging only to pass into the
priest himself, feeling all the more proud of dwelling in
a body dedicated to God. Who knows but these
simple Devils of Witches and shepherds might even
aspire to inhabit an inquisitor? He is far from easy
in mind when in his loudest voice he says to the old
woman, &#8220;If your master is so mighty, why do I not
feel his blows?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And, indeed I felt them but too strongly,&#8221; says
the poor man in his book. &#8220;When I was in Ratisbon,
how often he would come knocking at my windowpanes!
How often he stuck pins in my cap! A
hundred visions too did I have of dogs, monkeys,&#8221; &amp;c.</p>

<hr />

<p>The dearest delight of that great logician, the Devil,
is, by the mouth of the seeming old woman, to push
the doctor with awkward arguments, with crafty questions,
from which he can only escape by acting like
the fish who saves himself by troubling the water and
turning it black as ink. For instance, &#8220;The Devil
does no more than God allows him: why, then, punish
his tools?&#8221; Or again, &#8220;We are not free. As in the
case of Job, the Devil is allowed by God to tempt and
beset us, to urge us on by blows. Should we, then,
punish him who is not free?&#8221; Sprenger gets out of
that by saying, &#8220;We are free beings.&#8221; Here come<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
plenty of texts. &#8220;You are made serfs only by covenant
with the Evil One.&#8221; The answer to this would
be but too ready: &#8220;If God allows the Evil One to
tempt us into making covenants, he renders covenants
possible,&#8221; &amp;c.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am very good,&#8221; says he, &#8220;to listen to yonder
folk. He is a fool who argues with the Devil.&#8221; So
say all the rest likewise. They all cheer the progress
of the trial: all are strongly moved, and show in
murmurs their eagerness for the execution. They
have seen enough of men hanged. As for the Wizard
and the Witch, &#8217;twill be a curious treat to see those two
faggots crackling merrily in the flames.</p>

<p>The judge has the people on his side, so he is not
embarrassed. According to his <i>Directory</i> three witnesses
would be enough. Are not three witnesses
readily found, especially to witness a falsehood? In
every slanderous town, in every envious village teeming
with the mutual hate of neighbours, witnesses abound.
Besides, the <i>Directory</i> is a superannuated book, a century
old. In that century of light, the fifteenth, all
is brought to perfection. If witnesses are wanting,
we are content with the <i>public voice</i>, the general
clamour.<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>
<p>A genuine outcry, born of fear; the piteous cry of
victims, of the poor bewitched. Sprenger is greatly
moved thereat. Do not fancy him one of those unfeeling
schoolmen, the lovers of a dry abstraction.
He has a heart: for which very reason he is so ready
to kill. He is compassionate, full of lovingkindness.
He feels pity for yon weeping woman, but lately pregnant,
whose babe the witch had smothered by a look.
He feels pity for the poor man whose land she wasted
with hail. He pities the husband, who though himself
no wizard, clearly sees his wife to be a witch, and
drags her with a rope round her neck before Sprenger,
who has her burnt.</p>

<p>From a cruel judge escape was sometimes possible;
but from our worthy Sprenger it was hopeless. His
humanity is too strong: it needs great management, a
very large amount of ready wit, to avoid a burning at
his hands. One day there was brought before him the
plaint of three good ladies of Strasburg who, at one
same hour of the same day, had been struck by an arm
unseen. Ah, indeed! They are fain to accuse a man
of evil aspect, of having laid them under a spell. On
being brought before the inquisitor, the man vows
and swears by all the saints that he knows nothing
about these ladies, has never so much as seen them.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>The judge is hard of believing: nor tears nor oaths
avail aught with him. His great compassion for the
ladies made him inexorable, indignant at the man&#8217;s
denials. Already he was rising from his seat. The
man would have been tortured into confessing his
guilt, as the most innocent often did. He got leave
to speak, and said: &#8220;I remember, indeed, having
struck some one yesterday at the hour named; but
whom? No Christian beings, but only three cats
which came furiously biting at my legs.&#8221; The judge,
like a shrewd fellow, saw the whole truth of the
matter; the poor man was innocent; the ladies were
doubtless turned on certain days into cats, and the
Evil One amused himself by sending them at the legs
of Christian folk, in order to bring about the ruin of
these latter by making them pass for wizards.</p>

<p>A judge of less ability would never have hit upon
this. But such a man was not always to be had. It
was needful to have always handy on the table of the
Inquisition a good fool&#8217;s guide, to reveal to simple and
inexperienced judges the tricks of the Old Enemy, the
best way of baffling him, the clever and deep-laid
tactics employed with such happy effect by the great
Sprenger in his campaigns on the Rhine. To that
end the <i>Malleus</i>, which a man was required to carry
in his pocket, was commonly printed in small 18mo,
a form at that time scarce. It would not have been
seemly for a judge in difficulties to open a folio on the
table before his audience. But his handbook of folly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
he might easily squint at from the corner of his eye,
or turn over its leaves as he held it under the table.</p>

<hr />

<p>This <i>Malleus</i> (or Mallet), like all books of the same
class, contains a singular avowal, namely, that the
Devil is gaining ground; in other words, that God is
losing it; that mankind, after being saved by Christ,
is becoming the Devil&#8217;s prey. Too clearly indeed does
he step forward from legend to legend. What a way
he has made between the time of the Gospels, when he
was only too glad to get into the swine, and the days
of Dante, when, as lawyer and divine, he argues
with the saints, pleads his cause, and by way of closing
a successful syllogism, bears away the soul he was
fighting for, saying, with a triumphant laugh, &#8220;You
didn&#8217;t know that I was a logician!&#8221;</p>

<p>In the earlier days of the Middle Ages he waits till
the last pangs to seize the soul and bear it off. Saint
Hildegarde, about 1100, thinks that &#8220;<i>he cannot enter
the body of a living man</i>, for else his limbs would fly
off in all directions: it is but the shadow and the
smoke of the Devil which pass therein.&#8221; That last
gleam of good sense vanishes in the twelfth century.
In the thirteenth we find a suppliant so afraid of being
caught alive that he has himself watched day and
night by two hundred armed men.</p>

<p>Then begins a period of increasing terror, in which
men trust themselves less and ever less to God&#8217;s protection.
The Demon is no longer a stealthy sprite, no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
longer a thief by night, gliding through the gloom.
He becomes the fearless adversary, the daring ape of
Heaven, who in broad daylight mimics God&#8217;s creation
under God&#8217;s own sun. Is it the legends tell us this?
Nay, it is the greatest of the doctors. &#8220;The Devil,&#8221; says
Albert the Great, &#8220;transforms all living things.&#8221; St.
Thomas goes yet further. &#8220;All changes that may
occur naturally by means of seeds, can be copied by
the Devil.&#8221; What an astounding concession, which
coming from the mouth of so grave a personage, means
nothing short of setting up one Creator face to face
with another! &#8220;But in things done without the
germinal process,&#8221; he adds, &#8220;such as the changing of
men into beasts or the resurrection of the dead, there
the Devil can do nothing.&#8221; Thus to God is left the
smaller part of His work! He may only perform
miracles, a kind of action alike singular and infrequent.
But the daily miracle of life is not for Him alone: His
copyist, the Devil, shares with Him the world of
nature!</p>

<p>For man himself, whose weak eyes see no difference
between nature as sprung from God and nature as
made by the Devil, here is a world split in twain! A
dreadful uncertainty hangs over everything. Nature&#8217;s
innocence is gone. The clear spring, the pale flower,
the little bird, are these indeed of God, or only treacherous
counterfeits, snares laid out for man? Back! all
things look doubtful! The better of the two creations,
being suspiciously like the other, becomes eclipsed and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
conquered. The shadow of the Devil covers up the
day, spreads over all life. To judge by appearances
and the fears of men, he has ceased to share the world;
he has taken it all to himself.</p>

<p>So matters stand in the days of Sprenger. His
book teems with saddest avowals of God&#8217;s weakness.
&#8220;These things,&#8221; he says, &#8220;are done with God&#8217;s leave.&#8221;
To permit an illusion so entire, to let people believe that
God is nought and the Devil everything, is more than
mere <i>permission</i>; is tantamount to decreeing the damnation
of countless souls whom nothing can save from
such an error. No prayers, no penances, no pilgrimages,
are of any avail; nor even, so it is said, the sacrament
of the altar. Strange and mortifying avowal! The
very nuns who have just confessed themselves, declare
<i>while the host is yet in their mouths</i>, that even then
they feel the infernal lover troubling them without fear
or shame, troubling and refusing to leave his hold.
And being pressed with further questions, they add,
through their tears, that he has a body <i>because he has
a soul</i>.</p>

<hr />

<p>The Manichees of old, and the more modern Albigenses,
were charged with believing in the Power of
Evil struggling side by side with Good, with making
the Devil equal to God. Here, however, he is more
than equal; for if God through His holy sacrament has
still no power for good, the Devil certainly seems superior.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>I am not surprised at the wondrous sight then offered
by the world. Spain with a darksome fury, Germany
with the frightened pedantic rage certified in the
<i>Malleus</i>, assail the insolent conqueror through the
wretches in whom he chooses to dwell. They burn,
they destroy the dwellings in which he has taken up
his abode. Finding him too strong for men&#8217;s souls,
they try to hunt him out of their bodies. But what is
the good of it all? You burn one old woman and he
settles himself in her neighbour. Nay, more; if
Sprenger may be trusted, he fastens sometimes on the
exorcising priest, and triumphs over his very judge.</p>

<p>Among other expedients, the Dominicans advised
recourse to the intercession of the Virgin, by a continual
repeating of the <i>Ave Maria</i>. Sprenger, for his
part, always averred that such a remedy was but a
momentary one. You might be caught between two
prayers. Hence came the invention of the rosary, the
chaplet of beads, by means of which any number of
aves might be mumbled through, whilst the mind was
busied elsewhere. Whole populations adopted this first
essay of an art thereafter to be used by Loyola in his
attempt to govern the world, an art of which his
<i>Exercises</i> furnish the ingenious groundwork.</p>

<hr />

<p>All this seems opposed to what was said in the foregoing
chapter as to the decline of Witchcraft. The
Devil is now popular and everywhere present. He
seems to have come off conqueror: but has he gained<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
by his victory? What substantial profit has he reaped
therefrom?</p>

<p>Much, as beheld in his new phase of a scientific
rebellion which is about to bring forth the bright
Renaissance. None, if beheld under his old aspect, as
the gloomy Spirit of Witchcraft. The stories told of
him in the sixteenth century, if more numerous, more
widespread than ever, readily swing towards the grotesque.
People tremble, but they laugh withal.<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></p>

<h3>CENTURY OF TOLERATION IN FRANCE: REACTION.</h3>


<p class="noind"><span class="smcap">The</span> Church forfeited the wizard&#8217;s property to the
judge and the prosecutor. Wherever the Canon Law
was enforced the trials for witchcraft waxed numerous,
and brought much wealth to the clergy. Wherever
the lay tribunals claimed the management of these
trials they grew scarce and disappeared, at least for
a hundred years in France, from 1450 to 1550.</p>

<p>The first gleam of light shot forth from France in
the middle of the fifteenth century. The inquiry made
by Parliament into the trial of Joan of Arc, and her
after reinstalment, set people thinking on the intercourse
of spirits, good and bad; on the errors, also, of
the spiritual courts. She whom the English, whom
the greatest doctors of the Council of Basil pronounced
a Witch, appeared to Frenchmen a saint and sibyl. Her
reinstalment proclaimed to France the beginning of an
age of toleration. The Parliament of Paris likewise
reinstalled the alleged Waldenses of Arras. In 1498
it discharged as mad one who was brought before it as
a wizard. None such were condemned in the reigns
of Charles VIII., Louis XII., and Francis I.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p><hr />

<p>On the contrary, Spain, under the pious Isabella
(1506) and the Cardinal Ximenes, began burning
witches. In 1515, Geneva, being then under a Bishop,
burned five hundred in three months. The Emperor
Charles V., in his German Constitutions, vainly sought
to rule, that &#8220;Witchcraft, as causing damage to goods
and persons, is a question for <i>civil</i>, not ecclesiastic
law.&#8221; In vain did he do away the right of confiscation,
except in cases of treason. The small prince-bishops,
whose revenues were largely swelled by trials
for witchcraft, kept on burning at a furious rate. In
one moment, as it were, six hundred persons were
burnt in the infinitesimal bishopric of Bamberg, and
nine hundred in that of Wurtzburg. The way of
going to work was very simple. Begin by using torture
against the witnesses; create witnesses for the prosecution
by means of pain and terror; then, by dint of
excessive kindliness, draw from the accused a certain
avowal, and believe that avowal in the teeth of proven
facts. A witch, for instance, owns to having taken
from the graveyard the body of an infant lately dead,
that she might use it in her magical compounds. Her
husband bids them go the graveyard, for the child is
there still. On being disinterred, the child is found
all right in his coffin. But against the witness of his
own eyes the judge pronounces it <i>an appearance</i>, a
cheat of the Devil. He prefers the wife&#8217;s confession
to the fact itself; and she is burnt forthwith.<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>
<p>So far did matters go among these worthy prince-bishops,
that after a while, Ferdinand II., the most
bigoted of all emperors, the emperor of the Thirty
Years&#8217; War, was fain to interfere, to set up at Bamberg
an imperial commissary, who should maintain the
law of the empire, and see that the episcopal judge did
not begin the trial with tortures which settled it beforehand,
which led straight to the stake.</p>

<hr />

<p>Witches were easily caught by their confessions,
sometimes without the torture. Many of them were
half mad. They would own to turning themselves into
beasts. The Italian women often became cats, and
gliding under the doors, sucked, they said, the blood
of children. In the land of mighty forests, in Lorraine
and on the Jura, the women, of their own accord,
became wolves, and, if you could believe them, devoured
the passers by, even when nobody had passed by.
They were burnt. Some girls, who swore they had
given themselves to the Devil, were found to be
maidens still. They, too, were burnt. Several seemed
in a great hurry, as if they wanted to be burnt. Sometimes
it happened from raging madness, sometimes
from despair. An Englishwoman being led to the
stake, said to the people, &#8220;Do not blame my judges.
I wanted to put an end to my own self. My parents
kept aloof from me in their dread. My husband had
disowned me. I could not have lived on without disgrace.
I longed for death, and so I told a lie.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>The first words of open toleration against silly
Sprenger, his frightful Handbook, and his Inquisitors,
were spoken by Molitor, a lawyer of Constance. He
made this sensible remark, that the confessions of
witches should not be taken seriously, because it was
the very Father of Lies who spoke by their mouths.
He laughed at the miracles of Satan, affirming them
to be all illusory. In an indirect way, such jesters
as Hutten and Erasmus dealt violent blows at the
Inquisition, through their satires on the Dominican
idiots. Cardan<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> said, straightforwardly, &#8220;In order
to obtain forfeit property, the same persons acted as
accusers and judges, and invented a thousand stories
in proof.&#8221;</p>

<p>That apostle of toleration, Chatillon, who maintained
against Catholics and Protestants both, that
heretics should not be burnt, though he said nothing
about wizards, put men of sense in a better way.
Agrippa,<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> Lavatier, above all, Wyer<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>] the illustrious
physician of Cl&egrave;ves, rightly said that if those wretched
witches were the Devil&#8217;s plaything, we must lay the
blame on the Devil, not on them; must cure, instead
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>of burning them. Some physicians of Paris soon
pushed incredulity so far as to maintain that the
possessed and the witches were simply knaves. This
was going too far. Most of them were sufferers under
the sway of an illusion.</p>

<p>The dark reign of Henry II. and Diana of Poitiers
ends the season of toleration. Under Diana, they burn
heretics and wizards again. On the other hand, Catherine
of Medici, surrounded as she was by astrologers
and magicians, would have protected the latter. Their
numbers increased amain. The wizard Trois-Echelles,
who was tried in the reign of Charles IX., reckons
them at a hundred thousand, declaring all France to be
one Witch.</p>

<p>Agrippa and others affirm, that all science is contained
in magic. In white magic undoubtedly. But
the fears of fools and their fanatic rage, put little
difference between them. In spite of Wyer, in spite
of those true philosophers, Light and Toleration, a
strong reaction towards darkness set in from a quarter
whence it was least expected. Our magistrates, who for
nearly a century, had shown themselves enlightened
and fair-dealing, now threw themselves into the
Spanish Catholicon<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> and the fury of the Leaguists,<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a>
until they waxed more priest-like than the priests
themselves. While scouting the Inquisition from
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>France, they matched, and well-nigh eclipsed it by
their own deeds: the Parliament of Toulouse alone
sending four hundred human bodies at one time to the
stake. Think of the horror, the black smoke of all
that flesh, of the frightful melting and bubbling of the
fat amidst those piercing shrieks and yells! So
accursed, so sickening a sight had not been seen, since
the Albigenses were broiled and roasted.</p>

<p>But this is all too little for Bodin, lawyer of Angers,
and a violent adversary to Wyer. He begins by saying
that the wizards in Europe are numerous enough to
match Xerxes&#8217; army of eighteen hundred thousand
men. Then, like Caligula, he utters a prayer, that
these two millions might be gathered together, so as
he, Bodin, could sentence and burn them all at one
stroke.</p>

<hr />

<p>The new rivalry makes matters worse. The gentry
of the Law begin to say that the priest, being too
often connected with the wizard, is no longer a safe
judge. In fact, for a moment, the lawyers seem to be
yet more trustworthy. In Spain, the Jesuit pleader,
Del Rio; in Lorraine, Remy (1596); Boguet (1602) on
the Jura; Leloyer (1605) in Anjou; are all matchless
persecutors, who would have made Torquemada<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> himself
die of envy.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>
<p>In Lorraine there seemed to be quite a dreadful
plague of wizards and visionaries. Driven to despair
by the constant passing of troops and brigands, the
multitude prayed to the Devil only. They were drawn
on by the wizards. A number of villagers, frightened
by a twofold dread of wizards on the one hand, and
judges on the other, longed to leave their homes and
flee elsewhither, if Remy, Judge of Nancy, may be
believed. In the work he dedicated (1596) to the
Cardinal of Lorraine, he owns to having burnt eight
hundred witches, in sixteen years. &#8220;So well do I deal
out judgements,&#8221; he says, &#8220;that last year sixteen
slew themselves to avoid passing through my hands.&#8221;</p>

<hr />

<p>The priests felt humbled. Could they have done
better than the laity? Nay, even the monkish lords of
Saint Claude asked for a layman, honest Boguet, to sit
in judgment on their own people, who were much
given to witchcraft. In that sorry Jura, a poor land
of firs and scanty pasturage, the serf in his despair
yielded himself to the Devil. They all worshipped the
Black Cat.</p>

<p>Boguet&#8217;s book had immense weight. This Golden
Book, by the petty judge of Saint Claude, was
studied as a handbook by the worshipful members of
Parliament. In truth, Boguet is a thorough lawyer,
is even scrupulous in his own way. He finds fault<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
with the treachery shown in these prosecutions; will
not hear of barristers betraying their clients, of judges
promising pardon only to ensure the death of the
accused. He finds fault with the very doubtful tests to
which the witches were still exposed. &#8220;Torture,&#8221;
he says, &#8220;is needless: it never makes them yield.&#8221;
Moreover, he is humane enough to have them strangled
before throwing them to the flames, always except the
werewolves, &#8220;whom you must take care to burn alive.&#8221;
He cannot believe that Satan would make a compact
with children: &#8220;Satan is too sharp; knows too well
that, under fourteen years, any bargain made with
a minor, is annulled by default of years and due discretion.&#8221;
Then the children are saved? Not at all;
for he contradicts himself, and holds, moreover, that
such a leprosy cannot be purged away without burning
everything, even to the cradles. Had he lived, he would
have come to that. He made the country a desert:
never was there a judge who destroyed people with so
fine a conscience.</p>

<p>But it is to the Parliament of Bourdeaux that the
grand hurrah for lay jurisdiction is sent up in Lancre&#8217;s
book on <i>The Fickleness of Demons</i>. The author, a
man of some sense, a counsellor in this same Parliament,
tells with a triumphant air of his fight with the
Devil in the Basque country, where, in less than three
months, he got rid of I know not how many witches,
and, better still, of three priests. He looks compassionately<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
on the Spanish Inquisition, which at Logro&ntilde;o,
not far off, on the borders of Navarre and Castille,
dragged on a trial for two years, ending in the poorest
way by a small <i>auto-da-f&eacute;</i>, and the release of a whole
crowd of women.</p>

<p class="noind"><span class="smcap">That</span> strong-handed execution of the priests shows
M. Lancre to have been a man of independent spirit.
In politics he is the same. In his book on <i>The Prince</i>
(1617), he openly declares &#8220;the law to be above the
King.&#8221;</p>

<p>Never was the Basque character better drawn than
in his book on <i>The Fickleness of Demons</i>. In
France, as in Spain, the Basque people had privileges
which almost made them a republic. On our side they
owed the King no service but that of arms: at the first
beat of drum they were bound to gather two thousand
armed men commanded by Basque captains. They
were not oppressed by their clergy, who seldom prosecuted
wizards, being wizards themselves. The priests
danced, wore swords, and took their mistresses to the
Witches&#8217; Sabbath. These mistresses acted as their sextonesses
or <i>b&eacute;n&eacute;dictes</i>, to keep the churches in order.
The parson quarrelled with nobody, offered the White
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>Mass to God by day, the Black by night to the Devil,
and sometimes, according to Lancre, in the same
church.</p>

<p>The Basques of Bayonne and St. Jean de Luz, a
race of men quaint, venturesome, and fabulously bold,
left many widows, from their habit of sailing out into
the roughest seas to harpoon whales. Leaving their
wives to God or the Devil, they threw themselves in
crowds into the Canadian settlements of Henry IV.
As for the children, these honest worthy sailors would
have thought about them more, if they had been clear
as to their parentage. But on their return home they
would reckon up the months of their absence, and
they never found the reckoning right.</p>

<p>The women, bold, beautiful, imaginative, spent their
day seated on tombs in the grave-yards, talking of the
Sabbath, whither they expected to go in the evening.
This was their passion, their craze.</p>

<p>They are born witches, daughters of the sea and of
enchantment. They sport among the billows, swimming
like fish. Their natural master is the Prince of
the Air, King of Winds and Dreams, the same who inspired
the Sibyl and breathed to her the future.</p>

<p>The judge who burns them is charmed with them,
nevertheless. &#8220;When you see them pass,&#8221; says he,
&#8220;their hair flowing in the breeze about their shoulders,
they walk so trim, so bravely armed in that
fair head-dress, that the sun playing through it as
through a cloud, causes a mighty blaze which shoots<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
forth hot lightning-flashes. Hence the fascination of
their eyes, as dangerous in love as in witchcraft.&#8221;</p>

<p>This amiable Bordeaux magistrate, the earliest
sample of those worldly judges who enlivened the
gown in the seventeenth century, plays the lute between
whiles, and even makes the witches dance before
sending them to the stake. And he writes well, far
more clearly than anyone else. But for all that, one
discovers in his work a new source of obscurity, inherent
to those times. The witches being too numerous
for the judge to burn them all, the most of them
have a shrewd idea that he will show some indulgence
to those who enter deepest into his thoughts and
passions! What passions? you ask. First, his love of
the frightfully marvellous, a passion common enough;
the delight of feeling afraid; and also, if it must be
said, the enjoyment of unseemly pleasures. Add to
these a touch of vanity: the more dreadful and enraged
those clever women show the Devil to be, the greater
the pride taken by the judge in subduing so mighty
an adversary. He arrays himself as it were in his
victory, enthrones himself in his foolishness, triumphs
in his senseless twaddling.</p>

<p>The prettiest thing of this kind is the report of the
procedure in the Spanish <i>auto-da-f&eacute;</i> of Logro&ntilde;o, as
furnished to us by Llorente. Lancre, while quoting
him jealously and longing to disparage him, owns to
the surpassing charm of the festival, the splendour of
the sight, the moving power of the music. On one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
platform were the few condemned to the flames, on
another a crowd of reprieved criminals. The confession
of a repentant heroine who had dared all things,
is read aloud. Nothing could be wilder. At the
Sabbaths they ate children made into hash, and by way
of second course, the bodies of wizards disentombed.
Toads dance, and talk and complain lovingly of their
mistresses, getting them scolded by the Devil. The
latter politely escorts the witches home, lighting them
with the arm of a child who died unchristened, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Among our Basques witchcraft put on a less fantastic
guise. It seems that at this time the Sabbath was
only a grand feast to which all, the nobles included,
went for purposes of amusement. In the foremost line
would be seen persons in veils and masks, by some
supposed to be princes. &#8220;Once on a time,&#8221; says
Lancre, &#8220;none but idiots of the Landes appeared
there: now people of quality are seen to go.&#8221; To entertain
these local grandees, Satan sometimes created a
<i>Bishop of the Sabbath</i>. Such was the title he gave the
young lord Lancinena, with whom the Devil in person
was good enough to open the ball.</p>

<p>So well supported, the witches held their sway,
wielding over the land an amazing terrorism of the
fancy. Numbers regarded themselves as victims, and
became in fact seriously ill. Many were stricken with
epilepsy, and barked like dogs. In one small town of
Acqs were counted as many as forty of these barkers.
The Witch had so fearful a hold upon them, that one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
lady being called as witness, began barking with uncontrollable
fury as the Witch, unawares to herself,
drew near.</p>

<p>Those to whom was ascribed so terrible a power
lorded it everywhere. No one would dare shut his
door against them. One magistrate, the criminal
assessor of Bayonne, allowed the Sabbath to be held in
his own house. Urtubi, Lord of Saint P&eacute;, was forced
to hold the festival in his castle. But his head was
shaken to that degree, that he imagined a witch was
sucking his blood. Emboldened, however, by his fear,
he, with another gentleman, repaired to Bordeaux, and
persuaded the Parliament to obtain from the King the
commissioning of two of its members, Espagnet and
Lancre, to try the wizards in the Basque country. This
commission, absolute and without appeal, worked with
unheard-of vigour; in four months, from May to
August, 1609, condemned sixty or eighty witches, and
examined five hundred more, who, though equally
marked with the sign of the Devil, figured in the
proceedings as witnesses only.</p>

<hr />

<p>It was no safe matter for two men and a few
soldiers to carry on these trials amongst a violent, hot-headed
people, a multitude of wild and daring sailors&#8217;
wives. Another source of danger was in the priests,
many of whom were wizards, needing to be tried by
the lay commissioners, despite the lively opposition of
the clergy.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<p>When the judges appeared, many persons saved
themselves in the hills. Others boldly remained,
saying, it was the judges who would be burnt. So
little fear had the witches themselves, that before the
audience they would sink into the Sabbatic slumber,
and affirm on awaking that, even in court, they had
enjoyed the blessedness of Satan. Many said, they
only suffered from not being able to prove to him how
much they burned to suffer for his sake.</p>

<p>Those who were questioned said they could not
speak. Satan rising into their throats blocked up their
gullets. Lancre, who wrote this narrative, though the
younger of the commissioners, was a man of the world.
The witches guessed that, with a man of his sort, there
were means of saving themselves. The league between
them was broken. A beggar-girl of seventeen, La
Murgui, or Margaret, who had found witchcraft
gainful, and, while herself almost a child, had brought
away children as offerings to the Devil, now betook
herself, with another girl, Lisalda, of the same age, to
denouncing all the rest. By word of mouth or in
writing she revealed all; with the liveliness, the noise,
the emphatic gestures of a Spaniard, entering truly or
falsely into a hundred impure details. She frightened,
amused, wheedled her judges, drawing them after her
like fools. To this corrupt, wanton, crazy girl, they
entrusted the right of searching about the bodies of
girls and boys, for the spot whereon Satan had set his
mark. This spot discovered itself by a certain numbness,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
by the fact that you might stick needles into it
without causing pain. While a surgeon thus tormented
the elder ones, she took in hand the young,
who, though called as witnesses, might themselves be
accused, if she pronounced them to bear the mark. It
was a hateful thing to see this brazen-faced girl made
sole mistress of the fate of those wretched beings, commissioned
to prod them all over with needles, and able
at will to assign those bleeding bodies to death!</p>

<p>She had gotten so mighty a sway over Lancre, as to
persuade him that, while he was sleeping in Saint P&eacute;,
in his own house, guarded by his servants and his
escort, the Devil came by night into his room, to say
the Black Mass; while the witches getting inside his
very curtains, would have poisoned him, had he not
been well protected by God Himself. The Black Mass
was offered by the Lady of Lancinena, to whom Satan
made love in the very bedroom of the judge. We can
guess the likely aim of this wretched tale: the beggar
bore a grudge against the lady, who was good-looking,
and, but for this slander, might have come to bear
sway over the honest commissioner.</p>

<hr />

<p>Lancre and his colleague taking fright, went forward;
never dared to draw back. They had their royal
gallows set up on the very spots where Satan had held
a Sabbath. People were alarmed thereat, deeming them
strongly backed by the arm of royalty. Impeachments
hailed about them. The women all came in one long<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
string to accuse each other. Children were brought
forward to impeach their mothers. Lancre gravely
ruled that a child of eight was a good, sufficient, reputable
witness!</p>

<p>M. d&#8217;Espagnet could give but a few moments to
this matter, having speedily to show himself in the
Estates of B&eacute;arn. Lancre being pushed unwittingly
forward by the violence of the younger informers, who
would have fallen into great danger, if they had failed
to get the old ones burnt, threw the reins on the neck
of the business, and hurried it on at full gallop. A
due amount of witches were condemned to the stake.
These, too, on finding themselves lost, ended by impeaching
others. When the first batch were brought
to the stake, a frightful scene took place. Executioner,
constables, and sergeants, all thought their last hour
was come. The crowd fell savagely upon the carts,
seeking to force the wretches to withdraw their accusations.
The men put daggers to their throats: their
furious companions were like to finish them with their
nails.</p>

<p>Justice, however, got out of the scrape with some
credit; and then the commissioners went on to the
harder work of sentencing eight priests whom they had
taken up. The girls&#8217; confessions had brought these
men to light. Lancre speaks of their morals like one
who knew all about them of himself. He rebukes
them, not only for their gay proceedings on Sabbath
nights, but, most of all, for their sextonesses and female<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
churchwardens. He even repeats certain tales about
the priests having sent off the husbands to Newfoundland,
and brought back Devils from Japan who gave
up the wives into their hands.</p>

<p>The clergy were deeply stirred: the Bishop of
Bayonne would have made resistance. His courage
failing him, he appointed his vicar-general to act as
judge-assistant in his own absence. Luckily the Devil
gave the accused more help than their Bishop. He
opened all the doors, so that one morning five of the
eight were found missing. The commissioners lost no
time in burning the three still left to them.</p>

<hr />

<p>This happened about August, 1609. The Spanish
inquisitors at Logro&ntilde;o did not crown their proceedings
with an <i>auto-da-f&eacute;</i> before the 8th November, 1610.
They had met with far more trouble than our own
countrymen, owing to the frightful number of persons
accused. How burn a whole people? They sought
advice of the Pope, of the greatest doctors in Spain.
The word was given to draw back. Only the wilful
who persisted in denying their guilt, were to be burnt;
while they who pleaded guilty should be let go. The
same method had already been used to rescue priests
in trials for loose living. According to Llorente, it
was deemed sufficient, if they owned their crime, and
went through a slight penance.</p>

<p>The Inquisition, so deadly to heretics, so cruel to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
Moors and Jews, was much less so to wizards. These,
being mostly shepherds, had no quarrel with the
Church. The rejoicings of goatherds were too low, if
not too brutish, to disturb the enemies of free thought.</p>

<hr />

<p>Lancre wrote his book mainly to show how much
the justice of French Parliaments and laymen excelled
the justice of the priests. It is written lightly, merrily,
with flowing pen. It seems to express the joy felt by
one who has come creditably out of a great risk. It
is a gasconading, an over-boastful joy. He tells with
pride how, the Sabbath following the first execution of
the witches, their children went and wailed to Satan,
who replied that their mothers had not been burnt,
but were alive and happy. From the midst of the
crowd the children thought they heard their mothers&#8217;
voices saying how thoroughly blest they were. Satan
was frightened nevertheless. He absented himself for
four Sabbaths, sending a small commonplace devil in
his stead. He did not show himself again till the
22nd July. When the wizards asked him the reason
of his absence, he said, &#8220;I have been away, pleading
your cause against <i>Little John</i>,&#8221; the name by which he
called Jesus. &#8220;I have won the suit, and they who are
still in prison will not be burnt.&#8221;</p>

<p>The lie was given to the great liar. And the conquering
magistrate avers that, while the last witch was
burning, they saw a swarm of toads come out of her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
head. The people fell on them with stones, so that
she was rather stoned than burnt. But for all their
attacks, they could not put an end to one black toad
which escaped from flames, sticks, and stones, to hide,
like the Devil&#8217;s imp it was, in some spot where it could
never be found.<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a></p>

<h3>SATAN TURNS PRIEST.</h3>


<p class="noind"><span class="smcap">Whatever</span> semblance of Satanic fanaticism was still
preserved by the witches, it transpires from the narratives
of Lancre and other writers of the seventeenth
century, that the Sabbath then was mainly an affair of
money. They raised contributions almost by force,
charged something for right of entrance, and extracted
fines from those who stayed away. At Brussels and in
Picardy, they had a fixed scale of payment for rewarding
those who brought new members into the brotherhood.</p>

<p>In the Basque country no mystery was kept up.
The gatherings there would amount to twelve thousand
persons, of all classes, rich or poor, priests and gentlemen.
Satan, himself a gentleman, wore a hat upon
his three horns, like a man of quality. Finding his
old seat, the druidic stone, too hard for him, he treats
himself to an easy well-gilt arm-chair. Shall we say
he is growing old? More nimble now than when he
was young, he frolics about, cuts capers, and leaps
from the bottom of a large pitcher. He goes through
the service head downwards, his feet in the air.</p>

<p>He likes everything to go off quite respectably, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
spares no cost in his scenic arrangements. Besides
the customary flames, red, yellow, and blue, which
entertain the eye, as they show forth or hide the
flickering shadows, he charms the ear with strange
music, mainly of little bells that tickle the nerves with
something like the searching vibrations of musical-glasses.
To crown this splendour Satan bids them
bring out his silver plate. Even his toads give themselves
airs, become fashionable, and, like so many lordlings,
go about in green velvet.</p>

<p>The general effect is that of a large fair, of a great
masked ball with very transparent disguises. Satan,
who understands his epoch, opens the ball with the
Bishop of the Sabbath; or the King and Queen: offices
devised in compliment to the great personages, wealthy
or well-born, who honour the meeting by their presence.</p>

<p>Here may be seen no longer the gloomy feast of rebels,
the baleful orgie of serfs and boors, sharing by night
the sacrament of love, by day the sacrament of death.
The violent Sabbath-round is no more the one only
dance of the evening. Thereto are now added the
Moorish dances, lively or languishing, but always
amorous and obscene, in which girls dressed up for the
purpose, like <i>La Murgui</i> or <i>La Lisalda</i>, feigned and
showed off the most provoking characters. Among
the Basques these dances formed, we are told, the invincible
charm which sent the whole world of women,
wives, daughters, widows&mdash;the last in great numbers&mdash;headlong
into the Sabbath.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p>Without such amusements and the accompanying
banquet, one could hardly understand this general rage
for these Sabbaths. It is a kind of love without love;
a feast of barrenness undisguised. Boguet has settled
that point to a nicety. Differing in one passage,
where he dismisses the women as afraid of coming
to harm, Lancre is generally at one with Boguet, besides
being more sincere. The cruel and foul researches he
pursues on the very bodies of witches, show clearly
that he deemed them barren, and that a barren passive
love underlay the Sabbath itself.</p>

<p>The feast ought therefore to have been a dismal one,
if the men had owned the smallest heart.</p>

<p>The silly girls who went to dance and eat were victims
in every way. But they were resigned to everything
save the prospect of bearing children. They
bore indeed a far heavier load of wretchedness than the
men. Sprenger tells of the strange cry, which even in
his day burst forth in the hour of love, &#8220;May the
Devil have the fruits!&#8221; In his day, moreover, people
could live for two <i>sous</i> a day, while in the reign of
Henry IV., about 1600, they could barely live for
twenty. Through all that century the desire, the need
for barrenness grew more and more.</p>

<p>Under this growing dread of love&#8217;s allurements the
Sabbath would have become quite dull and wearisome,
had not the conductresses cleverly made the most of its
comic side, enlivening it with farcical interludes. Thus,
the opening scene in which Satan, like the Priapus of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
olden times, bestowed his coarse endearments on the
Witch, was followed by another game, a kind of chilly
purification, which the sorceress underwent with much
grimacing, and a great show of unpleasant shuddering.
Then came another swinish farce, described by Lancre
and Boguet, in which some young and pretty wife
would take the Witch&#8217;s place as Queen of the Sabbath,
and submit her body to the vilest handling. A farce
not less repulsive was the &#8220;Black Sacrament,&#8221; performed
with a black radish, which Satan would cut
into little pieces and gravely swallow.</p>

<p>The last act of all, according to Lancre, or at least
according to the two bold hussies who made him their
fool, was an astounding event to happen in such
crowded meetings. Since witchcraft had become
hereditary in whole families, there was no further need
of openly divulging the old incestuous ways of producing
witches, by the intercourse of a mother with
her son. Some sort of comedy perhaps was made out
of the old materials, in the shape of a grotesque Semiramis
or an imbecile Ninus. But the more serious
game, which doubtless really took place, attests the
existence of great profligacy in the upper walks of
society: it took the form of a most hateful and
barbarous hoax.</p>

<p>Some rash husband would be tempted to the spot,
so fuddled with a baleful draught of datura or belladonna,
that, like one entranced, he came to lose all
power of speech and motion, retaining only his sight.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
His wife, on the other hand, being so bewitched with
erotic drinks as to lose all sense of what she was doing,
would appear in a woeful state of nature, letting herself
be caressed under the indignant eyes of one who could
no longer help himself in the least. His manifest
despair, his bootless efforts to unshackle his tongue,
and set free his powerless limbs, his dumb rage and
wildly rolling eyes, inspired beholders with a cruel joy,
like that produced by some of Moli&egrave;re&#8217;s comedies.
The poor woman, stung with a real delight, yielded
herself up to the most shameful usage, of which on
the morrow neither herself nor her husband would
have the least remembrance. But those who had seen
or shared in the cruel farce, would they, too, fail to
remember?</p>

<p>In such heinous outrages an aristocratic element
seems traceable. In no way do they remind us of the
old brotherhood of serfs, of the original Sabbath, which,
though ungodly, and foul enough, was still a free
straightforward matter, in which all was done readily
and without constraint.</p>

<p>Clearly, Satan, depraved as he was from all time,
goes on spoiling more and more. A polite, a crafty
Satan is he now become, sweetly insipid, but all the
more faithless and unclean. It is a new, a strange
thing to see at the Sabbaths, his fellowship with priests.
Who is yon parson coming along with his <i>B&eacute;n&eacute;dicte</i>,
his sextoness, he who jobs the things of the Church,
saying the White Mass of mornings, the Black at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
night? &#8220;Satan,&#8221; says Lancre, &#8220;persuades him to make
love to his daughters in the spirit, to debauch his fair
penitents.&#8221; Innocent magistrate! He pretends to be
unaware that for a century back the Devil had been
working away at the Church livings, like one who
knew his business! He had made himself father-confessor;
or, if you would rather have it so, the father-confessor
had turned Devil.</p>

<p>The worthy M. de Lancre should have remembered
the trials that began in 1491, and helped perchance to
bring the Parliament of Paris into a tolerant frame of
mind. It gave up burning Satan, for it saw nothing
of him but a mask.</p>

<p>A good many nuns were conquered by his new
device of borrowing the form of some favourite confessor.
Among them was Jane Pothierre, a holy
woman of Quesnoy, of the ripe age of forty-five, but
still, alas! all too impressible. She owns her passion
to her ghostly counsellor, who loth to listen to her,
flies to Falempin, some leagues off. The Devil, who
never sleeps, saw his advantage, and perceiving her,
says the annalist, &#8220;goaded by the thorns of Venus, he
slily took the shape of the aforesaid &#8216;Father,&#8217; and
returning every night to the convent, was so successful
in befooling her, that she owned to having received
him 434 times.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> Great pity was felt for her on her
repenting; and she was speedily saved from all need
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>of blushing, being put into a fine walled-tomb built for
her in the Castle of Selles, where a few days after she
died the death of a good Catholic. Is it not a deeply
moving tale? But this is nothing to that fine business
of Gauffridi, which happened at Marseilles while
Lancre was drawing up deeds at Bayonne.</p>

<p>The Parliament of Provence had no need to envy the
success attained by that of Bordeaux. The lay authorities
caught at the first occasion of a trial for witchcraft
to institute a reform in the morals of the clergy.
They sent forth a stern glance towards the close-shut
convent-world. A rare opportunity was offered by the
strange concurrence of many causes, by the fierce
jealousies, the revengeful longings which severed priest
from priest. But for those mad passions which ere
long began to burst forth at every moment, we should
have gained no insight into the real lot of that great
world of women who died in those gloomy dwellings;
not one word should we have heard of the things that
passed behind those parlour gratings, within those
mighty walls which only the confessor could overleap.</p>

<p>The example of the Basque priest, whom Lancre
presents to us as worldly, trifling, going with his sword
upon him, and his deaconess by his side, to dance all
night at the Sabbath, was not one to inspire fear. It
was not such as he whom the Inquisition took such
pains to screen, or towards whom a body so stern for
others, proved itself, for once, indulgent. It is easy to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
see through all Lancre&#8217;s reticences the existence of
<i>something else</i>. And the States-General of 1614,
affirming that priests should not be tried by priests,
are also thinking of <i>something else</i>. This very mystery
it is which gets torn in twain by the Parliament
of Provence. The director of nuns gaining the
mastery over them and disposing of them, body and
soul, by means of witchcraft,&mdash;such is the fact which
comes forth from the trial of Gauffridi; at a later date
from the dreadful occurrences at Loudun and Louviers;
and also in the scenes described by Llorente, Ricci, and
several more.</p>

<p>One common method was employed alike for reducing
the scandal, for misleading the public, for
hiding away the inner fact while it was busied with
the outer aspects of it. On the trial of a priestly
wizard, all was done to juggle away the priest by
bringing out the wizard; to impute everything to the
art of the magician, and put out of sight the natural
fascination wielded by the master of a troop of women
all abandoned to his charge.</p>

<p>But there was no way of hushing up the first affair.
It had been noised abroad in all Provence, in a land
of light, where the sun pierces without any disguise.
The chief scene of it lay not only in Aix and Marseilles,
but also in Sainte-Baume, the famous centre of pilgrimage
for a crowd of curious people, who thronged
from all parts of France to be present at a deadly
duel between two bewitched nuns and their demons.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
The Dominicans, who attacked the affair as inquisitors,
committed themselves by the noise they made about it
through their partiality for one of these nuns. For
all the care Parliament presently took to hurry the
conclusion, these monks were exceedingly anxious to
excuse her and justify themselves. Hence the important
work of the monk Micha&euml;lis, a mixture of truth
and fable; wherein he raises Gauffridi, the priest he had
sent to the flames, into the Prince of Magicians, not
only in France, but even in Spain, Germany, England,
Turkey, nay, in the whole inhabited earth.</p>

<p>Gauffridi seems to have been a talented, agreeable
man. Born in the mountains of Provence, he had
travelled much in the Low Countries and the East.
He bore the highest character in Marseilles, where he
served as priest in the Church of Acoules. His bishop
made much of him: the most devout of the ladies
preferred him for their confessor. He had a wondrous
gift, they say, of endearing himself to all. Nevertheless,
he might have preserved his fair reputation had
not a noble lady of Provence, whom he had already
debauched, carried her blind, doting fondness to the
extent of entrusting him, perhaps for her religious
training, with the care of a charming child of twelve,
Madeline de la Palud, a girl of fair complexion and
gentle nature. Thereon, Gauffridi lost his wits, and
respected neither the youth nor the holy ignorance, the
utter unreserve of his pupil.</p>

<p>As she grew older, however, the young highborn<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
girl discovered her misfortune, in loving thus beneath
her, without hope of marriage. To keep his hold on
her, Gauffridi vowed he would wed her before the
Devil, if he might not wed her before God. He soothed
her pride by declaring that he was the Prince of Magicians,
and would make her his queen. He put on
her finger a silver ring, engraved with magic characters.
Did he take her to the Sabbath, or only make
her believe she had been there, by confusing her with
strange drinks and magnetic witcheries? Certain it
is, at least, that torn by two different beliefs, full of
uneasiness and fear, the girl thenceforth became mad
at certain times, and fell into fits of epilepsy. She
was afraid of being carried off alive by the Devil. She
durst no longer stay in her father&#8217;s house, and took
shelter in the Ursuline Convent at Marseilles.</p>

<h3>GAUFFRIDI: 1610.</h3>


<p class="noind"><span class="smcap">The</span> order of Ursuline nuns seemed to be the calmest,
the least irrational of them all. They were not wholly
idle, but found some little employment in the bringing
up of young girls. The Catholic reaction which, aiming
at a higher flight of ecstasy than was possible
at that time even in Spain, had foolishly built a
number of convents, Carmelite, Bernardine, and Capuchin,
soon found itself at the end of its motive-powers.
The girls of whom people got rid by shutting
them up so strictly therein, died off immediately, and
their swift decease led to frightful statements of the
cruelty shown by their families. They perished,
indeed, not by their excessive penances, but rather of
heart-sickness and despair. After the first heats of
zeal were over, the dreadful disease of the cloister,
described by Cassieu as dating from the fifteenth
century, that crushing, sickening sadness which came
on of an afternoon&mdash;that tender listlessness which
plunged them into a state of unutterable exhaustion,
speedily wore them away. A few among them would
turn as if raging mad, choking, as it were, with the
exceeding strength of their blood.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>

<p>A nun who hoped to die decently, without bequeathing
too large a share of remorse to her kindred, was
bound to live on about ten years, the mean term of life
in the cloister. She needed to be let gently down;
and men of sense and experience felt that her days
could only be prolonged by giving her something to do,
by leaving her not quite alone. St. Francis of Sales<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a>
founded the Visitandine order, whose duty it was to
visit the sick in pairs. C&aelig;sar of Bus and Romillion,
who had established the Teaching Priests in connection
with the Oratorians<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a>, afterwards ordained what might
be called the Teaching Sisters, the Ursulines, who
taught under the direction of the said priests. The
whole thing was under the supervision of the bishops,
and had very little of the monastic about it: the nuns
were not shut up again in cloisters. The Visitandines
went out; the Ursulines received, at any rate, their
pupils&#8217; kinsfolk. Both of them had connection with
the world under guardians of good repute. The result
was a certain mediocrity. Though the Oratorians and
the Doctrinaries numbered among them persons of
high merit, the general character of the order was
uniformly moderate, commonplace; it took care never
to soar too high. Romillion, founder of the Ursulines,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>was an oldish man, a convert from Protestantism, who
had roamed everywhere, and come back again to his
starting point. He deemed his young Provencials
wise enough already, and counted on keeping his little
flock on the slender pasturage of an Oratorian faith,
at once monotonous and rational. And being such, it
came in time to be utterly wearisome. One fine morning
all had disappeared.</p>

<p>Gauffridi, the mountaineer of Provence, the travelled
mystic, the man of strong feelings and restless mind,
had quite another effect upon them, when he came
thither as Madeline&#8217;s ghostly guide. They felt a certain
power, and by those who had already passed out of
their wild, amorous youth, were doubtless assured that
it was nothing less than a power begotten of the
Devil. All were seized with fear, and more than one
with love also. Their imaginations soared high; their
heads began to turn. Already six or seven may be seen
weeping, shrieking, yelling, fancying themselves caught
by the Devil. Had the Ursulines lived in cloisters,
within high walls, Gauffridi, being their only director,
might one way or another have made them all agree.
As in the cloisters of Quesnoy, in 1491, so here also it
might have happened that the Devil, who gladly takes
the form of one beloved, had under that of Gauffridi
made himself lover-general to the nuns. Or rather,
as in those Spanish cloisters named by Llorente, he
would have persuaded them that the priestly office
hallowed those to whom the priest made love, that to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
sin with him, was only to be sanctified. A notion, indeed,
ripe through France, and even in Paris, where the
mistresses of priests were called &#8220;the hallowed ones.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a></p>

<p>Did Gauffridi, thus master of all, keep to Madeline
only? Did not the lover change into the libertine?
We know not. The sentence points to a nun who
never showed herself during the trial, but reappeared
at the end, as having given herself up to the Devil and
to him.</p>

<p>The Ursuline convent was open to all visitors. The
nuns were under the charge of their Doctrinaries, men
of fair character, and jealous withal. The founder
himself was there, indignant, desperate. How woeful
a mishap for the rising order, just as it was thriving
amain and spreading all over France! After all its
pretensions to wisdom, calmness, good sense, thus
suddenly to go mad! Romillion would have hushed
up the matter if he could. He caused one of his
priests to exorcise the maidens. But the demons
laughed the exorciser to scorn. He who dwelt in the
fair damsel, even the noble demon Beelzebub, Spirit
of Pride, never deigned to unclose his teeth.</p>

<p>Among the possessed was one sister from twenty to
twenty-five years old, who had been specially adopted
by Romillion; a girl of good culture, bred up in controversy;
a Protestant by birth, but left an orphan, to
fall into the hands of the Father, a convert like herself
from Protestantism. Her name, Louisa Capeau,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>sounds plebeian. She showed herself but too clearly
a girl of exceeding wit, and of a raging passion. Her
strength, moreover, was fearful to see. For three
months, in addition to the hellish storm within, she
carried on a desperate struggle, which would have
killed the strongest man in a week.</p>

<p>She said she had three devils: Verrine, a good
Catholic devil, a volatile spirit of the air; Leviathan, a
wicked devil, an arguer and a Protestant; lastly,
another, acknowledged by her to be the spirit of
uncleanness. One other she forgot to name, the
demon of jealousy.</p>

<p>She bore a savage hate to the little fair-faced damsel,
the favoured rival, the proud young woman of rank.
This latter, in one of her fits, had said that she went
to the Sabbath, where she was made queen, and received
homage, and gave herself up, but only to the prince&mdash;&#8220;What
prince?&#8221; To Louis Gauffridi, prince of magicians.</p>

<p>Pierced by this revelation as by a dagger, Louisa
was too wild to doubt its truth. Mad herself, she
believed the mad woman&#8217;s story in order to ruin her.
Her own devil was backed by all the jealous demons.
The women all exclaimed that Gauffridi was the very
king of wizards. The report spread everywhere, that
a great prize had been taken, a priest-king of magicians,
even the prince of universal magic. Such was
the dreadful diadem of steel and flame which these
feminine demons drove into his brow.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span></p>

<p>Everyone lost his head, even to old Romillion himself.
Whether from hatred of Gauffridi, or fear of the
Inquisition, he took the matter out of the bishop&#8217;s
hands, and brought his two bewitched ones, Louisa and
Madeline, to the Convent of Sainte-Baume, whose prior
was the Dominican Micha&euml;lis, papal inquisitor in the
Pope&#8217;s domain of Avignon, and, as he himself pretended,
over all Provence. The great point was to get
them exorcised. But as the two women were obliged
to accuse Gauffridi, the business ended in making him
fall into the hands of the Inquisition.</p>

<p>Micha&euml;lis had to preach on Advent Sunday at Aix,
before the Parliament. He felt how much so striking
a drama would exalt him. He grasped at it with all
the eagerness of a barrister in a Criminal Court, when
a very dramatic murder, or a curious case of adultery
comes before him.</p>

<p>The right thing in matters of this sort was, to spin
out the play through Advent, Christmas, Lent, and
burn no one before the Holy Week, the vigil, as it
were, of the great day of Easter. Micha&euml;lis kept
himself for the last act, entrusting the bulk of the
business to a Flemish Dominican in his service, Doctor
Dompt, from Louvain, who had already exorcised, was
well-skilled in fooleries of that nature.</p>

<p>The best thing the Fleming could do, was to do
nothing. In Louisa, he found a terrible helpmate,
with thrice as much zeal in her as the Inquisition
itself, unquenchable in her rage, of a burning eloquence,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
whimsical, and sometimes very odd, but always
raising a shudder; a very torch of Hell.</p>

<p>The matter was reduced to a public duel between the
two devils, Louisa and Madeline.</p>

<p>Some simple folk who came thither on a pilgrimage
to Sainte-Baume, a worthy goldsmith, for instance,
and a draper, both from Troyes, in Champagne, were
charmed to see Louisa&#8217;s devil deal such cruel blows at
the other demons, and give so sound a thrashing to the
magicians. They wept for joy, and went away thanking
God.</p>

<p>It is a terrible sight, however, even in the dull wording
of the Fleming&#8217;s official statement, to look upon
this unequal strife; to watch the elder woman, the
strong and sturdy Provencial, come of a race hard as
the flints of its native Crau, as day after day she stones,
knocks down, and crushes her young and almost
childish victim, who, wasted with love and shame, has
already been fearfully punished by her own distemper,
her attacks of epilepsy.</p>

<p>The Fleming&#8217;s volume, which, with the additions
made by Micha&euml;lis, reaches to four hundred pages in
all, is one condensed epitome of the invectives, threats,
and insults spewed forth by this young woman in five
months; interspersed with sermons also, for she used
to preach on every subject, on the sacraments, on the
next coming of Antichrist, on the frailty of women,
and so forth. Thence, on the mention of her devils,
she fell into the old rage, and renewed twice a-day,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
the execution of the poor little girl; never taking
breath, never for one minute staying the frightful
torrent, until at least the other in her wild distraction,
&#8220;with one foot in hell&#8221;&mdash;to use her own words&mdash;should
have fallen into a convulsive fit, and begun
beating the flags with her knees, her body, her swooning
head.</p>

<p>It must be acknowledged that Louisa herself is a
trifle mad: no amount of mere knavishness would
have enabled her to maintain so long a wager. But
her jealousy points with frightful clearness to every
opening by which she may prick or rend the sufferer&#8217;s
heart.</p>

<p>Everything gets turned upside down. This Louisa,
possessed of the Devil, takes the sacrament whenever
she pleases. She scolds people of the highest
authority. The venerable Catherine of France, the
oldest of the Ursulines, came to see the wonder, asked
her questions, and at the very outset caught her telling
a flagrant and stupid falsehood. The impudent woman
got out of the mess by saying in the name of her evil
spirit, &#8220;The Devil is the Father of Lies.&#8221;</p>

<p>A sensible Minorite who was present, took up the
word and said, &#8220;Now, thou liest.&#8221; Turning to the
exorcisers, he added, &#8220;Cannot ye make her hold her
tongue?&#8221; Then he quoted to them the story of one
Martha, a sham demoniac of Paris. By way of answer,
she was made to take the communion before him. The
Devil communicate, the Devil receive the body of God!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
The poor man was bewildered; humbled himself before
the Inquisition. They were too many for him, so
he said not another word.</p>

<p>One of Louisa&#8217;s tricks was to frighten the bystanders,
by saying she could see wizards among them;
which made every one tremble for himself.</p>

<p>Triumphant over Sainte-Baume, she hits out even
at Marseilles. Her Flemish exorciser, being reduced
to the strange part of secretary and bosom-counsellor
to the Devil, writes, under her dictation, five letters:
first, to the Capuchins of Marseilles, that they may
call upon Gauffridi to recant; second, to the same
Capuchins, that they may arrest Gauffridi, bind him
fast with a stole, and keep him prisoner in a house of
her describing; thirdly, several letters to the moderate
party, to Catherine of France, to the Doctrinal Priests,
who had declared against her; and then this lewd,
outrageous termagant ends with insulting her own
prioress: &#8220;When I left, you bade me be humble and
obedient. Now take back your own advice.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her devil Verrine, spirit of air and wind, whispered
to her some trivial nonsense, words of senseless pride
which harmed friends and foes, and the Inquisition
itself. One day she took to laughing at Micha&euml;lis,
who was shivering at Aix, preaching in a desert while
all the world was gone to hear strange things at Sainte-Baume.
&#8220;Micha&euml;lis, you preach away, indeed, but
you get no further forward; while Louisa has reached,
has caught hold of the quintessence of all perfection.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>This savage joy was mainly caused by her having
quite conquered Madeline at last. One word had done
more for her than a hundred sermons: &#8220;Thou shalt
be burnt.&#8221; Thenceforth in her distraction the young
girl said whatever the other pleased, and upheld her
statements in the meanest way. Humbling herself
before them all, she besought forgiveness of her mother,
of her superior Romillion, of the bystanders, of Louisa.
According to the latter, the frightened girl took her
aside, and begged her to be merciful, not to chasten
her too much.</p>

<p>The other woman, tender as a rock and merciful as
a hidden reef, felt that Madeline was now hers, to do
whatever she might choose. She caught her, folded
her round, and bedazed her out of what little spirit
she had left. It was a second enchantment; but all
unlike that by Gauffridi, a <i>possession</i> by means of
terror. The poor downtrodden wretch, moving under
rod and scourge, was pushed onward in a path of exquisite
suffering which led her to accuse and murder
the man she loved still.</p>

<p>Had Madeline stood out, Gauffridi would have
escaped, for every one was against Louisa. Micha&euml;lis
himself at Aix, eclipsed by her as a preacher, treated
by her with so much coolness, would have stopped the
whole business rather than leave the honour of it in
her hands.</p>

<p>Marseilles supported Gauffridi, being fearful of seeing
the Inquisition of Avignon pushed into her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
neighbourhood, and one of her own children carried
off from her threshold. The Bishop and Chapter
were specially eager to defend their priest, maintaining
that the whole affair sprang from nothing but a rivalry
between confessors, nothing but the hatred commonly
shown by monks towards secular priests.</p>

<p>The Doctrinaries would have quashed the matter.
They were sore troubled by the noise it made. Some
of them in their annoyance were ready to give up
everything and forsake their house.</p>

<p>The ladies were very wroth, especially Madame
Libertat, the lady of the Royalist leader who had given
Marseilles up to the King.</p>

<p>The Capuchins whom Louisa had so haughtily commanded
to seize on Gauffridi, were, like all other of
the Franciscan orders, enemies of the Dominicans.
They were jealous of the prominence gained for these
latter by their demoniac friend. Their wandering life,
moreover, by throwing them into continual contact
with the women, brought them a good deal of moral
business. They had no wish to see too close a scrutiny
made into the lives of clergymen; and so they also
took the side of Gauffridi. Demoniacs were not so
scarce, but that one was easily found and brought
forward at the first summons. Her devil, obedient to
the rope-girdle of St. Francis, gainsaid everything said
by the Dominicans&#8217; devil: it averred&mdash;and the words
were straightway written down&mdash;that &#8220;Gauffridi was
no magician at all, and could not therefore be arrested.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>They were not prepared for this at Sainte-Baume.
Louisa seemed confounded. She could only manage
to say that apparently the Capuchins had not made
their devil swear to tell the truth: a sorry reply,
backed up, however, by the trembling Madeline, who,
like a beaten hound that fears yet another beating, was
ready for anything, ready even to bite and tear.
Through her it was that Louisa at such a crisis inflicted
an awful bite.</p>

<p>She herself merely said that the Bishop was offending
God unawares. She clamoured against &#8220;the
wizards of Marseilles&#8221; without naming any one. But
the cruel, the deadly word was spoken at her command
by Madeline. A woman who had lost her child two
years before, was pointed out by her as having throttled
it. Afraid of being tortured, she fled or hid herself.
Her husband, her father, went weeping to Sainte-Baume,
hoping of course to soften the inquisitors. But
Madeline durst not unsay her words; so she renewed
the charge.</p>

<p>No one now could feel safe. As soon as the Devil
came to be accounted God&#8217;s avenger, from the moment
that people under his dictation began writing the
names of those who should pass through the fire, every
one had before him, day and night, the hideous nightmare
of the stake.</p>

<p>To withstand these bold attempts of the Papal Inquisition,
Marseilles ought to have been backed up by
the Parliament of Aix. Unluckily she knew herself<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
to be little liked at Aix. That small official town of
magistrates and nobles was always jealous of the wealth
and splendour of Marseilles, the Queen of the South.
On the other hand, the great opponent of Marseilles,
the Papal Inquisitor, forestalled Gauffridi&#8217;s appeal to
the Parliament by carrying his own suit thither first.
This was a body of utter fanatics, headed by some heavy
nobles, whose wealth had been greatly increased in a
former century by the massacre of the Vaudois. As
lay judges, too, they were charmed to see a Papal Inquisitor
set the precedent of acknowledging that, in a
matter touching a priest, in a case of witchcraft, the
Inquisition could not go beyond the preliminary inquiry.
It was just as though the inquisitors had formally
laid aside their old pretensions. The people of
Aix, like those of Bordeaux before them, were also
bitten by the flattering thought, that these lay-folk
had been set up by the Church herself as censors and
reformers of the priestly morals.</p>

<p>In a business where all would needs be strange and
miraculous, not least among those marvels was it to
see so raging a demon grow all at once so fair-spoken
towards the Parliament, so politic and fine-mannered.
Louisa charmed the Royalists by her praises of the late
King. Henry IV.&mdash;who would have thought it?&mdash;was
canonized by the Devil. One morning, without
any invitation, he broke forth into praises of &#8220;that
pious and saintly King who had just gone up to
heaven.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>Such an agreement between two old enemies, the
Parliament and the Inquisition, which latter was
thenceforth sure of the secular arm, its soldiers, and
executioner; this and the sending of a commission to
Sainte-Baume to examine the possessed, take down
their statements, hear their charges, and impannel a
jury, made up a frightful business indeed. Louisa
openly pointed out the Capuchins, Gauffridi&#8217;s champions,
and proclaimed &#8220;their coming punishment
<i>temporally</i>&#8221; in their bodies, and in their flesh.</p>

<p>The poor Fathers were sorely bruised. Their devil
would not whisper one word. They went to find the
Bishop, and told him that indeed they might not
refuse to bring Gauffridi forward at Sainte-Baume, in
obedience to the secular power; but afterwards the
Bishop and Chapter could claim him back, and replace
him under the shelter of episcopal justice.</p>

<p>Doubtless they had also reckoned on the agitation
that would be shown by the two young women at the
sight of one they loved; on the extent to which even
the terrible Louisa might be shaken by the reproaches
of her own heart.</p>

<p>That heart indeed woke up at the guilty one&#8217;s approach:
for one moment the furious woman seemed to
grow tender. I know nothing more fiery than her
prayer for God to save the man she has driven to
death: &#8220;Great God, I offer thee all the sacrifices that
have been offered since the world began, that will be
offered until it ends. All, all, for Lewis. I offer thee<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
all the tears of every saint, all the transports of every
angel. All, all, for Lewis. Oh, that there were yet
more souls to reckon up, that so the oblation might
be all the greater! It should be all for Lewis. O
God, the Father of Heaven, have pity on Lewis! O
God the Son, Redeemer of the world, have pity on
Lewis!&#8221; &amp;c.</p>

<p>Bootless pity! baneful as well as bootless! Her
real desire was that the accused <i>should not harden his
heart</i>, should plead guilty. In that case by our laws
he would most assuredly be burnt.</p>

<p>She herself, in short, was worn out, unable to do
anything more. The inquisitor Micha&euml;lis was so
humbled by a victory he could not have gained without
her, so wroth with the Flemish exorciser who had
become her obedient follower, and let her see into all
the hidden springs of the tragedy, that he came simply
to crush Louisa, and save Madeline by substituting
the one for the other, if he could, in this popular
drama. This move of his implies some skill, and
a knowing eye for scenery. The winter and the
Advent season had been wholly taken up with the acting
of that awful sibyl, that raging bacchante. In
the milder days of a Provencial spring, in the season
of Lent, he would bring upon the scene a more moving
personage, a demon all womanly, dwelling in a sick
child, in a fair-haired frightened girl. The nobles and
the Parliament of Provence would feel an interest in a
little lady who belonged to an eminent house.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span></p>

<p>Far from listening to his Flemish agent, Louisa&#8217;s
follower, Micha&euml;lis shut the door upon him when he
sought to enter the select council of Parliament-men.
A Capuchin who also came, on the first words spoken
by Louisa, cried out, &#8220;Silence, accursed devil!&#8221;</p>

<p>Meanwhile Gauffridi had arrived at Sainte-Baume,
where he cut a sorry figure. A man of sense, but
weak and blameworthy, he foreboded but too truly how
that kind of popular tragedy would end; and in
coming to a strait so dreadful, he saw himself forsaken
and betrayed by the child he loved. He now
entirely forsook himself. When he was confronted
with Louisa, she seemed to him like a judge, like one
of those cruel and subtle schoolmen who judged the
causes of the Church. To all her questions concerning
doctrine, he only answered <i>yes</i>, assenting even to
points most open to dispute; as, for instance, to the
assumption &#8220;that the Devil in a court of justice might
be believed on his word and his oath.&#8221;</p>

<p>This lasted only a week, from the 1st to the 8th
January. The clergy of Marseilles demanded Gauffridi
back. His friends, the Capuchins, declared that they
had found no signs of magic in his room. Four canons
of Marseilles came with authority to take him, and
carried him away home.</p>

<p>If Gauffridi had fallen very low, his adversaries had
not risen much. Even the two inquisitors, Micha&euml;lis
and the Fleming, were in shameful variance with each
other. The partiality of the former for Madeline, of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
the latter for Louisa, went beyond mere words, leading
them into opposite lines of action. That chaos of
accusations, sermons, revelations, which the Devil had
dictated by the mouth of Louisa, the Fleming who
wrote it down maintained to be the very word of God,
and expressed his fear that somebody might tamper
with the same. He owned to a great mistrust of his
chief, Micha&euml;lis, who, he was sore afraid, would so
amend the papers in behalf of Madeline, as to ensure
the ruin of Louisa. To guard them to the best of his
power, he shut himself up in his room and underwent
a regular siege. Micha&euml;lis, with the Parliament-men
on his side, could only get at the manuscript by using
the King&#8217;s name and breaking the door open.</p>

<p>Louisa, afraid of nothing, sought to array the Pope
against the King. The Fleming carried an appeal to
the legate at Avignon, against his chief, Micha&euml;lis.
But the Papal Court had a prudent fear of causing
scandal by letting one inquisitor accuse another. Lacking
its support, the Fleming had no resource but to
submit. To keep him quiet Micha&euml;lis gave him back
his papers.</p>

<p>Those of Micha&euml;lis, forming a second report, dull
and nowise comparable with the former, are full of
nought but Madeline. They played music to try and
soothe her: care was taken to note down when she ate,
and when she did not eat. Too much time indeed was
taken up about her, often in a way but little edifying.
Strange questions are put to her touching the Magician,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
and what parts of his body might bear the mark
of the Devil. She herself was examined. This would
have to be done at Aix by surgeons and doctors; but
meanwhile, in the height of his zeal, Micha&euml;lis examined
her at Sainte-Baume, and put down the issue
of his researches. No matron was called to see her. The
judges, lay and monkish, agreeing in this one matter,
and having no fear of each other&#8217;s overlooking, seem
to have quietly passed over this contempt of outward
forms.</p>

<p>In Louisa, however, they found a judge. The bold
woman branded the indecency as with hot iron. &#8220;They
who were swallowed up by the Flood never behaved so
ill!... Even of thee, O Sodom, the like was never
said!&#8221;</p>

<p>She also averred that Madeline was given over to
uncleanness. This was the saddest thing of all. In
her blind joy at being alive, at escaping the flames, or
else from some cloudy notion that it was her turn now
to act upon her judges, the poor simpleton would sing
and dance at times with a shameful freedom, in a coarse,
indecent way. The old Doctrinal father, Romillion,
blushed for his Ursuline. Shocked to remark the admiration
of the men for her long hair, he said that such
a vanity must be taken from her, be cut away.</p>

<p>In her better moments she was gentle and obedient.</p>

<p>They would have liked to make her a second Louisa;
but her devils were vain and amorous; not, like the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
other&#8217;s, eloquent and raging. When they wanted her
to preach, she could only utter sorry things. Micha&euml;lis
was fain to play out the piece by himself. As chief
inquisitor, and bound greatly to outdo his Flemish
underling, he avowed that he had already drawn out of
this small body a host of six thousand, six hundred,
and sixty devils: only a hundred still remained. By
way of convincing the public, he made her throw up
the charm or spell which by his account she had swallowed,
and he drew it from her mouth in some slimy
matter. Who could hold out any longer? Assurance
itself stood stupefied and convinced.</p>

<p>Madeline was in a fair way to escape: the only
hindrance was herself. Every moment she would be
saying something rash, something to arouse the misgivings
of her judges, and urge them beyond all
patience. She declared that everything to her recalled
Gauffridi, that everywhere she saw him present. Nor
would she hide from them her dreams of love. &#8220;To-night,&#8221;
she said, &#8220;I was at the Sabbath. To my statue
all covered with gilding the magicians offered their
homage. Each of them, in honour thereof, made oblation
of some blood drawn from his hands with a lancet.
<i>He</i> was also there, on his knees, a rope round his neck,
beseeching me to go back and betray him not. I held
out. Then said he, &#8216;Is there anyone here who would
die for her?&#8217; &#8216;I,&#8217; said a young man, and he was
sacrificed by the magician.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>At another time she saw him, and he asked her only
for one of her fine fair locks. &#8220;And when I refused,
he said, &#8216;Only the half of one hair.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>She swore, however, that she never yielded. But
one day, the door happening to be open, behold our
convert running off at the top of her speed to rejoin
Gauffridi!</p>

<p>They took her again, at least her body. But her
soul? Micha&euml;lis knew not how to catch that again.
Luckily he caught sight of her magic ring, which was
taken off, cut up, destroyed, and thrown into the fire.
Fancying, moreover, that this perverseness on the part
of one so gentle was due to unseen wizards who found
their way into her room, he set there a very substantial
man at arms, with a sword to slash about him everywhere,
and cut the invisible imps into pieces.</p>

<p>But the best physic for the conversion of Madeline
was the death of Gauffridi. On the 5th February, the
inquisitor went to Aix for his Lent preachings, saw the
judges, and stirred them up. The Parliament, swiftly
yielding to such a pressure, sent off to Marseilles an
order to seize the rash man, who, finding himself so
well backed by Bishop, Chapter, Capuchins, and all the
world, had fancied they would never dare so far.</p>

<p>Madeline from one quarter, Gauffridi from another,
arrived at Aix. She was so disturbed that they were
forced to bind her. Her disorder was frightful, and all
were in great perplexity what to do. They bethought
them at least of one bold way of dealing with this sick<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
child; one of those fearful tricks that throw a woman
into fits, and sometimes kill her outright. A vicar-general
of the archbishopric said that the palace contained
a dark narrow charnel-house, such as you may
see in the Escurial, and called in Spain a &#8220;rotting vat.&#8221;</p>

<p>There, in olden days, old bones of unknown dead
were left to waste away. Into this tomb-like cave the
trembling girl was led. They exorcised her by putting
those chilly bones to her face. She did not die of
fright, but thenceforth gave herself up to their will and
pleasure; and so they got what they wanted, the death
of the conscience, the destruction of all that remained
to her of moral insight and free will.</p>

<p>She became their pliant tool, ready to obey their
least desire, to flatter them, to try and guess beforehand
what would give them most pleasure. Huguenots were
brought before her: she called them names. Confronted
with Gauffridi, she told forth by heart her grievances
against him, better than the King&#8217;s own officers could
have done. This did not prevent her from squalling
violently, when she was brought to the church to excite
the people against Gauffridi, by making her devil blaspheme
in the magician&#8217;s name. Beelzebub speaking
through her said, &#8220;In the name of Gauffridi I abjure
God;&#8221; and again, at the lifting up of the Host, &#8220;Let
the blood of the just be upon me, in the name of
Gauffridi!&#8221;</p>

<p>An awful fellowship indeed! This twofold devil
condemns one out of the other&#8217;s mouth; whatever<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
Madeline says, is ascribed to Gauffridi. And the
scared crowd were impatient to behold the burning of
the dumb blasphemer, whose ungodliness so loudly
declared itself by the voice of the girl.</p>

<p>The exorcisers then put to her this cruel question,
to which they themselves could have given the best
answer:&mdash;&#8220;Why, Beelzebub, do you speak so ill of
your great friend?&#8221; Her answer was frightful: &#8220;If
there be traitors among men, why not among demons
also? When I am with Gauffridi, I am his to do all
his will. But when you constrain me, I betray him
and turn him to scorn.&#8221;</p>

<p>However, she could not keep up this hateful mockery.
Though the demon of fear and fawning seemed to
have gotten fast hold of her, there was room still for
despair. She could no longer take the slightest food;
and they who for five months had been killing her
with exorcisms and pretending to relieve her of six or
seven thousand devils, were fain to admit that she
longed only to die, and greedily sought after any means
of self-destruction. Courage alone was wanting to her.
Once she pricked herself with a lancet, but lacked the
spirit to persevere. Once she caught up a knife, and
when that was taken from her, tried to strangle herself.
She dug needles into her body, and then made
one last foolish effort to drive a long pin through her
ear into her head.</p>

<p>What became of Gauffridi? The inquisitor, who
dwells so long on the two women, says almost nothing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
about him. He walks as it were over the fire. The
little he does say is very strange. He relates that
having bound Gauffridi&#8217;s eyes, they pricked him with
needles all over the body, to find out the callous places
where the Devil had made his mark. On the removal
of the bandage, he learned, to his horror and amazement,
that the needle had thrice been stuck into him
without his feeling it; so he was marked in three places
with the sign of Hell. And the inquisitor added, &#8220;If
we were in Avignon, this man should be burnt to-morrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>He felt himself a lost man; and defended himself no
more. His only thought now was to see if he could
save his life through any of the Dominicans&#8217; foes. He
wished, he said, to confess himself to the Oratorians.
But this new order, which might have been called the
right mean of Catholicism, was too cold and wary to
take up a matter already so hopeless and so far
advanced.</p>

<p>Thereon he went back again to the Begging Friars,
confessing himself to the Capuchins, and acknowledging
all and more than all the truth, that he might
purchase life with dishonour. In Spain he would
assuredly have been enlarged, barring a term of
penance in some convent. But our Parliaments were
sterner: they felt bound to prove the greater purity of
the lay jurisdiction. The Capuchins, themselves a
little shaky in the matter of morals, were not the people
to draw the lightning down on their own body. They<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
surrounded Gauffridi, sheltered him, gave him comfort
day and night; but only in order that he might own
himself a magician, and so, because magic formed the
main head of his indictment, the seduction wrought
by a confessor to the great discredit of the clergy might
be left entirely in the background.</p>

<p>So his friends the Capuchins, by dint of tender
caresses and urgent counsel, drew from him the fatal
confession which, by their showing, was to save his
soul, but which was very certain to hand his body over
to the stake.</p>

<p>The man thus lost and done for, they made an end
with the girls whom it was not their part to burn. A
farcical scene took place. In a large gathering of the
clergy and the Parliament, Madeline was made to
appear, and, in words addressed to herself, her devil
Beelzebub was summoned to quit the place or else offer
some opposition. Not caring to do the latter, he went
off in disgrace.</p>

<p>Then Louisa, with her demon Verrine, was made to
appear. But before they drove away a spirit so
friendly to the Church, the monks regaled the Parliamentaries,
who were new to such things, with the
clever management of this devil, making him perform
a curious pantomime. &#8220;How do the Seraphim, the
Cherubim, the Thrones, behave before God?&#8221; &#8220;A
hard matter this:&#8221; says Louisa, &#8220;they have no
bodies.&#8221; But on their repeating the command, she
made an effort to obey, imitating the flight of the one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
class, the fiery longing of the others; and ending with
the adoration, when she bowed herself before the
judges, falling prostrate with her head downwards.
Then was the far-famed Louisa, so proud and so untamable,
seen to abase herself, kissing the pavement,
and with outstretched arms laying all her length
thereon.</p>

<p>It was a strange, frivolous, unseemly exhibition, by
which she was made to atone for her terrible success
among the people. Once more she won the assembly
by dealing a cruel dagger-stroke at Gauffridi, who
stood there strongly bound. &#8220;Where,&#8221; said they, &#8220;is
Beelzebub now, the devil who went out of Madeline?&#8221;
&#8220;I see him plainly at Gauffridi&#8217;s ear.&#8221;</p>

<p>Have you had shame and horror enough? We
should like further to know what the poor wretch said,
when put to the torture. Both the ordinary and the
extraordinary forms were used upon him. His revelations
must undoubtedly have thrown light on the
curious history of the nunneries. Those tales the
Parliament stored up with greediness, as weapons that
might prove serviceable to itself; but it retained them
&#8220;under the seal of the Court.&#8221;</p>

<p>The inquisitor Micha&euml;lis, who was fiercely assailed
in public for an excess of animosity so closely resembling
jealousy, was summoned by his order to a meeting at
Paris, and never saw the execution of Gauffridi, who
was burnt alive four days afterwards, 30th April,
1611, at Aix.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p>

<p>The name of the Dominicans, damaged by this trial,
was not much exalted by another case of <i>possession</i>
got up at Beauvais in such a way as to ensure them
all the honours of a war, the account of which they
got printed in Paris. Louisa&#8217;s devil having been reproached
for not speaking Latin, the new demoniac,
Denise Lacaille, mingled a few words of it in her gibberish.
They made a plenty of noise about her, often
displayed her in the midst of a procession, and even
carried her from Beauvais to Our Lady of Liesse. But
the matter kept quite cool. This Picard pilgrimage
lacked the horror, the dramatic force of the affair at
Sainte-Baume. This Lacaille, for all her Latin, had
neither the burning eloquence, nor the mettle, nor the
fierce rage, that marked the woman of Provence. The
only end of all her proceedings was to amuse the
Huguenots.</p>

<p>What became of the two rivals, Madeline and
Louisa? The former, or at least her shadow, was kept
on Papal ground, for fear of her being led to speak
about so mournful a business. She was never shown
in public, save in the character of a penitent. She
was taken out among the poor women to cut wood,
which was afterwards sold for alms; the parents, whom
she had brought to shame, having forsworn and forsaken
her.</p>

<p>Louisa, for her part, had said during the trial: &#8220;I
shall make no boast about it. The trial over, I shall
soon be dead.&#8221; But this was not to be. Instead of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
dying, she went on killing others. The murdering
devil within her waxed stormier than ever. She set
about revealing to the inquisitors the names, both
Christian and surnames, of all whom she fancied to
have any dealings with magic; among others a poor
girl named Honoria, &#8220;blind of both eyes,&#8221; who was
burnt alive.</p>

<p>&#8220;God grant,&#8221; says Father Micha&euml;lis, in conclusion,
&#8220;that all this may redound to His own glory and to
that of His Church!&#8221;</p>

<h3>THE DEMONIACS OF LOUDUN&mdash;URBAN GRANDIER:
1632-1634.</h3>


<p class="noind"><span class="smcap">In</span> the <i>State Memoirs</i>, written by the famous
Father Joseph, and known to us by extracts only&mdash;the
work itself having, no doubt, been wisely suppressed
as too instructive&mdash;the good Father explained how, in
1633, he had the luck to discover a heresy, a huge
heresy, in which ever so many confessors and directors
were concerned. That excellent army of Church-constables,
those dogs of the Holy Troop, the Capuchins,
had, not only in the wildernesses, but even in the
populous parts of France&mdash;at Chartres, in Picardy,
everywhere&mdash;got scent of some dreadful game; the
<i>Alumbrados</i> namely, or Illuminate, of Spain, who
being sorely persecuted there, had fled for shelter into
France, where, in the world of women, especially among
the convents, they dropped the gentle poison which
was afterwards called by the name of Molinos.<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a></p>

<p>The wonder was, that the matter had not been
sooner known. Having spread so far, it could not
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>have been wholly hidden. The Capuchins swore that
in Picardy alone, where the girls are weak and warmer-blooded
than in the South, this amorously mystic folly
owned some sixty thousand professors. Did all the
clergy share in it&mdash;all the confessors and directors?
We must remember, that attached to the official directors
were a good many laymen, who glowed with
the same zeal for the souls of women. One of them,
who afterwards made some noise by his talent and
boldness, is the author of <i>Spiritual Delights</i>, Desmarets
of Saint Sorlin.</p>

<hr />

<p>Without remembering the new state of things, we
should fail to understand the all-powerful attitude of
the director towards the nuns, of whom he was now
a hundred-fold more the master than he had been in
days of yore.</p>

<p>The reforming movement of the Council of Trent,
for the better enclosing of monasteries, was not much
followed up in the reign of Henry IV., when the nuns
received company, gave balls, danced, and so forth. In
the reign, however, of Louis XIII., it began afresh
with greater earnestness. The Cardinal Rochefoucauld,
or rather the Jesuits who drew him on, insisted on a
great deal of outward decency. Shall we say, then,
that all entrance into the convents was forbidden?
One man only went in every day, not only into the
house, but also, if he chose, into each of the cells; a
fact made evident from several known cases, especially<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
that of David at Louviers. By this reform, this closing
system, the door was shut upon the world at large,
on all inconvenient rivals, while the director enjoyed
the sole command of his nuns, the special right of
private interviews with them.</p>

<p>What would come of this? The speculative might
treat it as a problem; not so practical men or physicians.
The physician Wyer tells some plain stories
to show what did come of it from the sixteenth century
onwards. In his Fourth Book he quotes a number
of nuns who went mad for love. And in Book
III. he talks of an estimable Spanish priest who, going
by chance into a nunnery, came out mad, declaring
that the brides of Jesus were his also, brides of the
priest, who was a vicar of Jesus. He had masses said
in return for the favour which God had granted him in
this speedy marriage with a whole convent.</p>

<p>If this was the result of one passing visit, we may
understand the plight of a director of nuns when he
was left alone with them, and could take advantage of
the new restrictions to spend the day among them,
listening hour by hour to the perilous secret of their
languishings and their weaknesses.</p>

<p>In the plight of these girls the mere senses are not
all in all. Allowance must be made for their listlessness
of mind; for the absolute need of some change in
their way of life; of some dream or diversion to relieve
their lifelong monotony. Strange things are happening
constantly at this period. Travels, events in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
Indies, the discovery of a world, the invention of
printing: what romance there is everywhere! While
all this goes on without, putting men&#8217;s minds into a
flutter, how, think you, can those within bear up
against the oppressive sameness of monastic life&mdash;the
irksomeness of its lengthy services, seasoned by
nothing better than a sermon preached through the
nose?</p>

<hr />

<p>The laity themselves, living amidst so many distractions,
desire, nay insist, that their confessors shall absolve
them for their acts of inconstancy. The priests,
on their side, are drawn or forced on, step by step.
There grows up a vast literature, at once various and
learned, of casuistry, of the art of allowing all things;
a progressive literature, in which the indulgence of to-night
seems to become the severity of the morrow.</p>

<p>This casuistry was meant for the world; that mysticism
for the convent. The annihilation of the person
and the death of the will form the great mystic principle.
The true moral bearings of that principle are
well shown by Desmarets. &#8220;The devout,&#8221; he says,
&#8220;having offered up and annihilated their own selves,
exist no longer but in God. <i>Thenceforth they can do
no wrong.</i> The better part of them is so divine that it
no longer knows what the other is doing.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span></p>
<p>It might have been thought that the zealous Joseph
who had raised so loud a cry of alarm against these
corrupt teachers, would have gone yet further; that a
grand searching inquiry would have taken place; that
the countless host whose number, in one province
only, were reckoned at sixty thousand, would be found
out and closely examined. But not so: they disappear,
and nothing more is known about them. A few, it is
said, were imprisoned; but trial there was none: only
a deep silence. To all appearance Richelieu cared but
little about fathoming the business. In his tenderness
for the Capuchins he was not so blind as to follow their
lead in a matter which would have thrown the supervision
of all confessors into their hands.</p>

<p>As a rule, the monks had a jealous dislike of the
secular clergy. Entire masters of the Spanish women,
they were too dirty to be relished by those of France;
who preferred going to their own priests or to some
Jesuit confessor, an amphious creature, half monk,
half worldling. If Richelieu had once let loose the pack
of Capuchins, Recollects, Carmelites, Dominicans, &amp;c.,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>who among the clergy would have been safe? What
director, what priest, however upright, but had used,
and used amiss, the gentle language of the Quietists
towards their penitents?</p>

<p>Richelieu took care not to trouble the clergy, while
he was already bringing about the General Assembly
from which he was soon to ask a contribution towards
the war. One trial alone was granted the monks, the
trial of a vicar, but a vicar who dealt in magic; a
trial wherein matters were allowed, as in the case of
Gauffridi, to get so entangled, that no confessor, no
director, saw his own likeness there, but everyone in
full security could say, &#8220;This is not I.&#8221;</p>

<hr />

<p>Thanks to these strict precautions the Grandier
affair is involved in some obscurity.<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> Its historian,
the Capuchin Tranquille, proves convincingly that
Grandier was a wizard, and, still more, a devil; and on
the trial he is called, as Ashtaroth might have been
called, <i>Grandier of the Dominations</i>. On the other
hand, M&eacute;nage is ready to rank him with great men
accused of magic, with the martyrs of free thought.</p>

<p>In order to see a little more clearly, we must not set
Grandier by himself; we must keep his place in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>devilish trilogy of those times, in which he figured
only as a second act; we must explain him by the
first act, already shown to us in the dreadful business
of Sainte-Baume, and the death of Gauffridi; we must
explain him by the third act, by the affair at Louviers,
which copied Loudun, as Loudun had copied Sainte-Baume,
and which in its turn owned a Gauffridi and
an Urban Grandier.</p>

<p>The three cases are one and selfsame. In each case
there is a libertine priest, in each a jealous monk, and
a frantic nun by whose mouth the Devil is made to
speak; and in all three the priest gets burnt at last.</p>

<p>And here you may notice one source of light which
makes these matters clearer to our eyes than if we saw
them through the miry shades of a monastery in Spain
or Italy. In those lands of Southern laziness, the nuns
were astoundingly passive, enduring the life of the
seraglio and even worse.<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> Our French women, on the
contrary, gifted with a personality at once strong,
lively, and hard to please, were equally dreadful in
their jealousy and in their hate; and being devils indeed
without metaphor, were accordingly rash, blusterous,
and prompt to accuse. Their revelations were
very plain, so plain indeed at the last, that everyone
felt ashamed; and after thirty years and three special
cases, the whole thing, begun as it was through terror,
got fairly extinguished in its own dulness beneath
hisses of general disgust.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span></p>
<p>It was not in Loudun, amidst crowds of Poitevins,
in the presence of so many scoffing Huguenots, in the
very town where they held their great national synods,
that one would have looked for an event so discreditable
to the Catholics. But these latter, living, as it were, in
a conquered country,<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> in the old Protestant towns,
with the greatest freedom, and thinking, not without
cause, of the people they had often massacred and but
lately overcome, were not the persons to say a word
about it. Catholic Loudun, composed of magistrates,
priests, monks, a few nobles, and some workmen,
dwelled aloof from the rest, like a true conquering settlement.
This settlement, as one might easily guess,
was rent in twain by the rivalry of the priests and the
monks.</p>

<hr />

<p>The monks, being numerous and proud, as men specially
sent forth to make converts, kept the pick of the
pavement against the Protestants, and were confessing
the Catholic ladies, when there arrived from Bordeaux
a young vicar, brought up by the Jesuits, a man of
letters, of pleasing manners, who wrote well and spoke
better. He made a noise in the pulpit, and ere long
in the world. By birth a townsman of Mantes, of a
wrangling turn, he was Southern by education, with all
the readiness of a Bordelais, boastful and frivolous as a
Gascon. He soon managed to set the whole town by
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>the ears, drawing the women to his side, while the
men were mostly against him. He became lofty, insolent,
unbearable, devoid of respect for everything. The
Carmelites he overwhelmed with jibes; he would rail
away from his pulpit against monks in general. They
choked with rage at his sermons. Proud and stately,
he went along the streets of Loudun like a Father of
the Church; but by night he would steal, with less of
bluster, down the byeways and through back-doors.</p>

<p>They all surrendered themselves to his pleasure.
The wife of the Crown Counsel was aware of his
charms; still more so the daughter of the Public
Prosecutor, who had a child by him. This did not
satisfy him. Master of the ladies, this conqueror
pushed his advantage until he had gained the nuns.</p>

<p>By that time the Ursulines abounded everywhere,
sisters devoted to education, feminine missionaries in a
Protestant land, who courted and pleased the mothers,
while they won over the little girls. The nuns of
Loudun formed a small convent of young ladies, poor
and well-born. The convent in itself was poor, the
nuns for whom it was founded, having been granted
nothing but their house, an old Huguenot college.
The prioress, a lady of good birth and high connections,
burned to exalt her nunnery, to enlarge it, make
it wealthier and wider known. Perhaps she would
have chosen Grandier, as being then the fashion, had she
not already gotten for her director a priest with very
different rootage in the country, a near kinsman of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
two chief magistrates. The Canon Mignon, as he was
called, held the prioress fast. These two were enraged
at learning through the confessional&mdash;the &#8220;Ladies
Superior&#8221; might confess their nuns&mdash;that the young
nuns dreamed of nothing but this Grandier, of whom
there was so much talk.</p>

<p>Thereupon three parties, the threatened director,
the cheated husband, the outraged father, joined together
by a common jealousy, swore together the
destruction of Grandier. To ensure success, they only
needed to let him go on. He was ruining himself
quite fast enough. An incident that came to light
made noise enough almost to bring down the town.</p>

<hr />

<p>The nuns placed in that old Huguenot mansion,
were far from easy in their minds. Their boarders,
children of the town, and perhaps also some of the
younger nuns, had amused themselves with frightening
the rest by playing at ghosts and apparitions. Little
enough of order was there among this throng of rich
spoilt girls. They would run about the passages at
night, until they frightened themselves. Some of
them were sick, or else sick at heart. But these fears
and fancies mingled with the gossip of the town, of
which they heard but too much during the day, until
the ghost by night took the form of Grandier himself.
Several said they saw him, felt him near them in the
night, and yielded unawares to his bold advances.
Was all this fancy, or the fun of novices? Had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
Grandier bribed the porteress or ventured to climb
the walls? This part of the business was never
cleared up.</p>

<p>From that time the three felt sure of catching him.
And first, among the small folk under their protection,
they stirred up two good souls to declare that they
could no longer keep as vicar a profligate, a wizard, a
devil, a freethinker, who bent one knee in church
instead of two, who scoffed at rules and granted dispensations
contrary to the rights of the Bishop. A shrewd
accusation, which turned against him his natural defender,
the Bishop of Poitiers, and delivered him over
to the fury of the monks.</p>

<p>To say truth, all this was planned with much skill.
Besides raising up two poor people as accusers, they
thought it advisable to have him cudgelled by a noble.
In those days of duelling a man who let himself be
cudgelled with impunity lost ground with the public,
and sank in the esteem of the women. Grandier deeply
felt the blow. Fond of making a noise in all cases, he
went to the King, threw himself on his knees, and besought
vengeance for the insult to his gown. From so
devout a king he might have gained it; but here there
chanced to be some persons who told the King that it
was all an affair of love, the fury of a betrayed husband
wreaking itself on his foe.</p>

<p>At the spiritual court of Poitiers, Grandier was condemned
to do penance, to be banished from Loudun,
and disgraced as a priest. But the civil court took up<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
the matter and found him innocent. He had still to
await the orders of him by whom Poitiers was spiritually
overruled, Sourdis, Archbishop of Bordeaux.
That warlike prelate, an admiral and brave sailor more
than a priest, shrugged his shoulders on hearing of
such peccadilloes. He acquitted the vicar, but at the
same time wisely recommended him to go and live
anywhere out of Loudun.</p>

<p>This the proud man did not care to do. He wanted
to enjoy his triumph on the very field of battle, to
show off before the ladies. He came back to Loudun
in broad day, with mighty noise; the women all looking
out of window, as he went by with a laurel-branch
in his hand.</p>

<hr />

<p>Not satisfied with that piece of folly, he began to
threaten, to demand reparation. Thus pushed and
imperilled in their turn, his enemies called to remembrance
the affair of Gauffridi, where the Devil, the
Father of Lies, was restored to his honours and accepted
in a court of justice as a right truthful witness,
worthy of belief on the side of the Church, worthy of
belief on the side of His Majesty&#8217;s servants. In despair
they invoked a devil and found one at their command.
He showed himself among the Ursulines.</p>

<p>A dangerous thing; but then, how many were nearly
concerned in its success! The prioress saw her poor
humble convent suddenly attracting the gaze of the
Court, of the provinces, of all the world. The monks<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
saw themselves victorious over their rivals the priests.
They pictured anew those popular battles waged
with the Devil in a former century, and often, as at
Soissons, before the church doors; the terror of the
people, and their joy at the triumph of the Good
Spirit; the confession drawn from the Devil touching
God&#8217;s presence in the Sacrament; and the humiliation
of the Huguenots at being refuted by the Demon himself.</p>

<p>In these tragi-comedies the exorciser represented
God, or at any rate the Archangel, overthrowing the
dragon. He came down from the platform in utter
exhaustion, streaming with sweat, but victorious, to be
borne away in the arms of the crowd, amidst the
blessings of good women who shed tears of joy the
while.</p>

<p>Therefore it was that in these trials a dash of witchcraft
was always needful. The Devil alone roused the
interest of the vulgar. They could not always see
him coming out of a body in the shape of a black
toad, as at Bordeaux in 1610. But it was easy to
make it up to them by a grand display of splendid
stage scenery. The affair of Provence owed much of
its success to Madeline&#8217;s desolate wildness and the
terror of Sainte-Baume. Loudun was regaled with
the uproar and the bacchanal frenzy of a host of exorcisers
distributed among several churches. Lastly,
Louviers, as we shall presently see, put a little new life
into this fading fashion by inventing midnight scenes,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
in which the demons who possessed the nuns began
digging by the glimmer of torches, until they drew
forth certain charms from the holes wherein they had
been concealed.</p>

<hr />

<p>The Loudun business began with the prioress and
a lay sister of hers. They had convulsive fits, and
talked infernal gibberish. Other of the nuns began
copying them, one bold girl especially taking up
Louisa&#8217;s part at Marseilles, with the same devil Leviathan,
the leading demon of trickery and evil speaking.</p>

<p>The little town was all in a tremble. Monks of
every hue provided themselves with nuns, shared them
all round, and exorcised them by threes and fours.
The churches were parcelled out among them; the
Capuchins alone taking two for themselves. The
crowd go after them, swollen by all the women in the
place, and in this frightened audience, throbbing with
anxiety, more than one cries out that she, too, is feeling
the devils.<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> Six girls of the town are possessed.
And the bare recital of these alarming events begets
two new cases of possession at Chinon.</p>

<p>Everywhere the thing was talked of, at Paris, at the
Court. Our Spanish queen,<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> who is imaginative and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>devout, sends off her almoner; nay more, sends her
faithful follower, the old papist, Lord Montague, who
sees, who believes everything, and reports it all to the
Pope. It is a miracle proven. He had seen the
wounds on a certain nun, and the marks made by the
Devil on the Lady Superior&#8217;s hands.</p>

<p>What said the King of France to this? All his
devotion was turned on the Devil, on hell, on thoughts
of fear. It is said that Richelieu was glad to keep him
thus. I doubt it; the demons were essentially Spanish,
taking the Spanish side: if ever they talked politics,
they must have spoken against Richelieu. Perhaps
he was afraid of them. At any rate, he did them
homage, and sent his niece to prove the interest he
took in the matter.</p>

<hr />

<p>The Court believed, but Loudun itself did not. Its
devils, but sorry imitators of the Marseilles demons,
rehearsed in the morning what they had learnt the
night before from the well-known handbook of Father
Micha&euml;lis. They would never have known what to
say but for the secret exorcisms, the careful rehearsal
of the day&#8217;s farce, by which night after night they
were trained to figure before the people.</p>

<p>One sturdy magistrate, bailiff of the town, made a
stir: going himself to detect the knaves, he threatened
and denounced them. Such, too, was the tacit
opinion of the Archbishop of Bordeaux, to whom
Grandier appealed. He despatched a set of rules for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
the guidance at least of the exorcisers, for putting a
stop to their arbitrary doings; and, better still, he
sent his surgeon, who examined the girls, and found
them to be neither bewitched, nor mad, nor even sick.
What were they then? Knaves, to be sure.<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a></p>

<p>So through the century keeps on this noble duel
between the Physician and the Devil, this battle of
light and knowledge with the dark shades of falsehood.
We saw its beginning in Agrippa and Wyer. Doctor
Duncan carried it bravely on at Loudun, and fearlessly
impressed on others the belief that this affair was
nothing but a farce.</p>

<p>For all his alleged resistance, the Demon was frightened,
held his tongue, quite lost his voice. But people&#8217;s
passions had been too fiercely roused for the matter to
end there. The tide flowed again so strongly in favour
of Grandier, that the assailed became in their turn
assailants. An apothecary of kin to the accusers was
sued by a rich young lady of the town for speaking of
her as the vicar&#8217;s mistress. He was condemned to
apologise for his slander.</p>

<p>The prioress was a lost woman. It would have been
easy to prove, what one witness afterwards saw, that
the marks upon her were made with paint renewed
daily. But she was kinswoman to one of the King&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>judges, Laubardemont, and he saved her. He was
simply charged to overthrow the strong places of
Loudun. He got himself commissioned to try Grandier.
The Cardinal was given to understand that the
accused was vicar and friend of the <i>Loudun shoemaker</i>,<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a>
was one of the numerous agents of Mary
of Medici, had made himself his parishioner&#8217;s secretary,
and written a disgraceful pamphlet in her name.</p>

<p>Richelieu, for his part, would have liked to show a
high-minded scorn of the whole business, if he could
have done so with safety to himself. The Capuchins
and Father Joseph had an eye to that also. Richelieu
would have given them a fine handle against him with
the King, had he displayed a want of zeal. One
Quillet, after much grave reflection, went to see the
Minister and give him warning. But the other, afraid
to listen, regarded him with so stern a gaze that the
giver of advice deemed it prudent to seek shelter in
Italy.</p>

<hr />

<p>Laubardemont arrived at Loudun on the 6th December,
1633, bringing along with him great fear, and
unbounded powers; even those of the King himself.
The whole strength of the kingdom became, as it were,
a dreadful bludgeon to crush one little fly.</p>

<p>The magistrates were wroth; the civic lieutenant
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>warned Grandier that he would have to arrest him on
the morrow. The latter paid no heed to him, and was
arrested accordingly. In a moment he was carried off,
without form of trial, to the dungeons of Angers. Presently
he was taken back and thrown, where think
you? Into the house, the room of one of his enemies,
who had the windows walled up so as well-nigh to
choke him. The loathsome scrutiny of the wizard&#8217;s
body, in order to find out the Devil&#8217;s marks by sticking
needles all over it, was carried on by the hands of the
accusers themselves, who took their revenge upon him
beforehand in the foretaste thus given him of his future
punishment.</p>

<p>They led him to the churches, confronted him with
the girls, who had got their cue from Laubardemont.
These Bacchanals, for such they became under the
fuddling effect of some drugs administered by the condemned
apothecary above-named, flung out in such
frantic rages, that Grandier was nearly perishing one
day beneath their nails.</p>

<p>Unable to imitate the eloquence of the Marseilles
demoniac, they tried obscenity in its stead. It was a
hideous thing to see these girls give full vent in public
to their sensual fury, on the plea of scolding their
pretended devils. Thus indeed it was that they
managed to swell their audiences. People flocked to
hear from the lips of these women what no woman
would else have dared to utter.</p>

<p>As the matter grew more hateful, so it also grew<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
more laughable. They were sure to repeat all awry
what little Latin was ever whispered to them. The
public found that the devils had never gone through
<i>their lower classes</i>. The Capuchins, however, coolly
said that if these demons were weak in Latin, they
were marvellous speakers of Iroquois and Tupinambi.<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a></p>

<hr />

<p>A farce so shameful, seen from a distance of sixty
leagues, from St. Germain or the Louvre, appeared
miraculous, awful, terrifying. The Court admired and
trembled. Richelieu to please them did a cowardly
thing. He ordered money to be paid to the exorcisers,
to the nuns.</p>

<p>The height of favour to which they had risen, drove
the plotters altogether mad. Senseless words were
followed by shameful deeds. Pleading that the nuns
were tired, the exorcisers got them outside the town,
took them about by themselves. One of them, at least
to all appearance, returned pregnant. In the fifth or
sixth month all outward trace of it disappeared, and
the devil within her acknowledged how wickedly he
had slandered the poor nun by making her look so
large. This tale concerning Loudun we learn from the
historian of Louviers.<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a></p>

<p>It is stated that Father Joseph, after a secret journey
to the spot, saw to what end the matter was coming,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>and noiselessly backed out of it. The Jesuits also
went, tried their exorcisms, did next to nothing, got
scent of the general feeling, and stole off in like
manner.</p>

<p>But the monks, the Capuchins, were gone so far,
that they could only save themselves by frightening
others. They laid some treacherous snares for the
daring bailiff and his wife, seeking to destroy them,
and thereby quench the coming reaction of justice.
Lastly, they urged on the commissioners to despatch
Grandier. Things could be carried no further: the
nuns themselves were slipping out of their hands.
After that dreadful orgie of sensual rage and immodest
shouting in order to obtain the shedding of human
blood, two or three of them swooned away, were seized
with disgust and horror; vomited up their very selves.
Despite the hideous doom that awaited them if
they spoke the truth, despite the certainty of ending
their days in a dungeon, they owned in church that
they were damned, that they had been playing with
the Devil, and Grandier was innocent.</p>

<hr />

<p>They ruined themselves, but could not stay the
issue. A general protest by the town to the King
failed to stay it also. On the 18th August, 1634,
Grandier was condemned to the stake. So violent
were his enemies that, for the second time before
burning him, they insisted on having him stuck with
needles in order to find out the Devil&#8217;s marks. One<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
of his judges would have had even his nails torn out
of him, had not the surgeon withheld his leave.</p>

<p>They were afraid of the last words their victim might
say on the scaffold. Among his papers there had
been found a manuscript condemning the celibacy of
priests, and those who called him a wizard themselves
believed him to be a freethinker. They remembered
the brave words which the martyrs of free thought had
thrown out against their judges; they called to mind
the last speech of Giordano Bruno, the bold defiance of
Vanini.<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> So they agreed with Grandier, that if he
were prudent, he should be saved from burning, perhaps
be strangled. The weak priest, being a man of
flesh, yielded to this demand of the flesh, and promised
to say nothing. He spoke not a word on the road,
nor yet upon the scaffold. When he was fairly fastened
to the post, with everything ready, and the fire so
arranged as to enfold him swiftly in smoke and flames,
his own confessor, a monk, set the faggots ablaze without
waiting for the executioner. The victim, pledged to
silence, had only time to say, &#8220;So, you have deceived
me!&#8221; when the flames whirled fiercely upwards, and
the furnace of pain began, and nothing was audible
save the wretch&#8217;s screams.</p>

<p>Richelieu in his Memoirs says little, and that with
evident shame, concerning this affair. He gives one
to believe that he only followed the reports that reached
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>him, the voice of general opinion. Nevertheless, by
rewarding the exorcisers, by throwing the reins to the
Capuchins, and letting them triumph over France, he
gave no slight encouragement to that piece of knavery.
Gauffridi, thus renewed in Grandier, is about to reappear
in yet fouler plight in the Louviers affair.</p>

<p>In this very year, 1634, the demons hunted from
Poitou pass over into Normandy, copying again and
again the fooleries of Sainte-Baume, without any trace
of invention, of talent, or of imagination. The frantic
Leviathan of Provence, when counterfeited at Loudun,
loses his Southern sting, and only gets out of a scrape
by talking fluently to virgins in the language of Sodom.
Presently, alas! at Louviers he loses even his old
daring, imbibes the sluggish temper of the North, and
sinks into a sorry sprite.<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a></p>

<h3>THE DEMONIACS OF LOUVIERS&mdash;MADELINE BAVENT:
1633-1647.</h3>


<p class="noind"><span class="smcap">Had</span> Richelieu allowed the inquiry demanded by Father
Joseph into the doings of the Illuminate Confessors,
some strange light would have been thrown into the
depth of the cloisters, on the daily life of the nuns.
Failing that, we may still learn from the Louviers
story, which is far more instructive than those of Aix
and Loudun, that, notwithstanding the new means of
corruption furnished by Illuminism, the director still
resorted to the old trickeries of witchcraft, of apparitions,
heavenly or infernal, and so forth.<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a></p>

<p>Of the three directors successively appointed to the
Convent of Louviers in the space of thirty years, David,
the first, was an Illuminate, who forestalled Molinos;
the second, Picart, was a wizard dealing with the Devil;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>and Boull&eacute;, the third, was a wizard working in the
guise of an angel.</p>

<p>There is an excellent book about this business; it is
called <i>The History of Magdalen Bavent</i>, a nun of
Louviers; with her Examination, &amp;c., 1652: Rouen.<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a>
The date of this book accounts for the thorough
freedom with which it was written. During the wars
of the Fronde, a bold Oratorian priest, who discovered
the nun in one of the Rouen prisons, took courage
from her dictation to write down the story of her
life.</p>

<p>Born at Rouen in 1607, Madeline was left an
orphan at nine years old. At twelve she was apprenticed
to a milliner. The confessor, a Franciscan,
held absolute sway in the house of this milliner, who
as maker of clothes for the nuns, was dependent on
the Church. The monk caused the apprentices, whom
he doubtless made drunk with belladonna and other
magical drinks, to believe that they had been taken to
the Sabbath and there married to the devil Dagon.
Three were already possessed by him, and Madeline at
fourteen became the fourth.</p>

<p>She was a devout worshipper, especially of St.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>Francis. A Franciscan monastery had just been
founded at Louviers, by a lady of Rouen, widow of
lawyer Hennequin, who was hanged for cheating. She
hoped by this good deed of hers to help in saving her
husband&#8217;s soul. To that end she sought counsel of a
holy man, the old priest David, who became director
to the new foundation. Standing at the entrance of
the town, with a wood surrounding it, this convent,
born of so tragical a source, seemed quite gloomy and
poor enough for a place of stern devotion. David was
known as author of a <i>Scourge for Rakes</i>, an odd and
violent book against the abuses that defiled the
Cloister.<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> All of a sudden this austere person took
up some very strange ideas concerning purity. He
became an Adamite, preached up the nakedness of
Adam in his days of innocence. The docile nuns of
Louviers sought to subdue and abase the novices, to
break them into obedience, by insisting&mdash;of course in
summer-time&mdash;that these young Eves should return to
the plight of their common mother. In this state they
were sent out for exercise in some secluded gardens,
and were taken into the chapel itself. Madeline, who
at sixteen had come to be received as a novice, was too
proud, perhaps in those days too pure also, to submit
to so strange a way of life. She got an angry scolding
for having tried at communion to hide her bosom with
the altar-cloth.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span></p>
<p>Not less unwilling was she to uncover her soul, to
confess to the Lady Superior, after the usual monastic
custom of which the abbesses were particularly fond.
She would rather trust herself with old David, who kept
her apart from the rest. He himself confided his own
ailments into her ear. Nor did he hide from her his
inner teaching, the Illuminism, which governed the
convent: &#8220;You must kill sin by being made humble
and lost to all sense of pride through sin.&#8221; Madeline
was frightened at the depths of depravity reached by
the nuns, who quietly carried out the teaching with
which they had been imbued. She avoided their company,
kept to herself, and succeeded in getting made
one of the doorkeepers.</p>

<hr />

<p>David died when she was eighteen. Old age prevented
his going far with the girl. But the vicar
Picart, who succeeded him, was furious in his pursuit
of her; at the confessional spoke to her only of his
love. He made her his sextoness, that he might meet
her alone in chapel. She liked him not; but the nuns
forbade her to have another confessor, lest she might
divulge their little secrets. And thus she was given
over to Picart. He beset her when she was sick almost
to death; seeking to frighten her by insisting that
from David he had received some infernal prescriptions.
He sought to win her compassion by feigning illness
and begging her to come and see him. Thenceforth
he became her master, upset her mind with magic<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
potions, and worked her into believing that she had
gone with him to the Sabbath, there to officiate as altar
and victim. At length, exceeding even the Sabbath
usages and daring the scandal that would follow, he
made her to be with child.</p>

<p>The nuns were afraid of one who knew the state of
their morals; and their interest also bound them to
him. The convent was enriched by his energy, his
good repute, the alms and gifts he attracted towards it
from every quarter. He was building them a large
church. We saw in the Loudun business by what
rivalries and ambitions these houses were led away,
how jealously they strove each to outdo the others.
Through the trust reposed in him by the wealthy,
Picart saw himself raised into the lofty part of benefactor
and second founder of the convent. &#8220;Sweetheart,&#8221;
he said to Madeline, &#8220;that noble church is
all my building! After my death you will see wonders
wrought there. Do you not agree to that?&#8221;</p>

<p>This fine gentleman did not put himself out at
all regarding Madeline. He paid a dowry for her, and
made a nun of her who was already a lay-sister. Thus,
being no longer a doorkeeper, she could live in one of
the inner rooms, and there be brought to bed at her
convenience. By means of certain drugs, and practices
of their own, the convents could do without the help of
doctors. Madeline said that she was delivered several
times. She never said what became of the newly-born.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span></p>

<p>Picart being now an old man, feared lest Madeline
might in her fickleness fly off some day, and utter
words of remorse to another confessor. So he took a
detestable way of binding her to himself beyond recall,
by forcing her to make a will in which she promised
&#8220;to die when he died, and to be wherever he was.&#8221;
This was a dreadful thought for the poor soul. Must
she be drawn along with him into the bottomless pit?
Must she go down with him, even into hell? She
deemed herself for ever lost. Become his property, his
mere tool, she was used and misused by him for all
kinds of purposes. He made her do the most shameful
things. He employed her as a magical charm to
gain over the rest of the nuns. A holy wafer steeped
in Madeline&#8217;s blood, and buried in the garden, would
be sure to disturb their senses and their minds.</p>

<p>This was the very year in which Urban Grandier was
burnt. Throughout France, men spoke of nothing
but the devils of Loudun. The Penitentiary of Evreux,
who had been one of the actors on that stage, carried
the dreadful tale back with him to Normandy. Madeline
fancied herself bewitched and knocked about by
devils; followed about by a lewd cat with eyes of fire.
By degrees, other nuns caught the disorder, which
showed itself in odd supernatural jerks and writhings.
Madeline had besought aid of a Capuchin, afterwards
of the Bishop of Evreux. The prioress was not sorry
for a step of which she must have been aware, for she
saw what wealth and fame a like business had brought<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
to the Convent of Loudun. But for six years the
bishop turned a deaf ear to the prayer, doubtless
through fear of Richelieu, who was then at work on a
reform of the cloisters.</p>

<p>Richelieu wanted to bring these scandals to an end.
It was not till his own death, and that of Louis XIII.,
during the break-up which followed on the rule of the
Queen and Mazarin, that the priests again betook
themselves to working wonders, and waging war with
the Devil. Picart being dead, they were less shy of a
matter in which so dangerous a man might have
accused others in his turn. They met the visions of
Madeline, by looking out a visionary for themselves.
They got admission into the convent for a certain
Sister Anne of the Nativity, a girl of sanguine,
hysteric temperament, frantic at need and half-mad,
so far at least as to believe in her own lies. A kind
of dogfight was got up between the two. They
besmeared each other with false charges. Anne saw
the Devil quite naked, by Madeline&#8217;s side. Madeline
swore to seeing Anne at the Sabbath, along with the
Lady Superior, the Mother-Assistant, and the Mother
of the Novices. Besides this, there was nothing new;
merely a hashing up of the two great trials at Aix and
Loudun. They read and followed the printed narratives
only. No wit, no invention, was shown by
either.</p>

<p>Anne, the accuser, and her devil Leviathan, were
backed by the Penitentiary of Evreux, one of the chief<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
actors in the Loudun affair. By his advice, the Bishop
of Evreux gave orders to disinter the body of Picart, so
that the devils might leave the convent when Picart
himself was taken away from the neighbourhood.
Madeline was condemned, without a hearing, to be disgraced,
to have her body examined for the marks of the
Devil. They tore off her veil and gown, and made her
the wretched sport of a vile curiosity, that would have
pierced her till she bled again, in order to win the
right of sending her to the stake. Leaving to no one
else the care of a scrutiny which was in itself a torture,
these virgins acting as matrons, ascertained if she was
with child or no, shaved all her body, and dug their
needles into her quivering flesh, to find out the insensible
spots that betrayed the mark of the Devil. At
every dig they discovered signs of pain: if they had
not the luck to prove her a Witch, at any rate, they
could revel in her tears and cries.</p>

<hr />

<p>But Sister Anne was not satisfied, until, on the mere
word of her own devil, Madeline, though acquitted by
the results of this examination, was condemned for the
rest of her life to an <i>In pace</i>. It was said that the
convent would be quieted by her departure; but such
was not the case. The Devil was more violent than
ever; some twenty nuns began to cry out, to prophesy,
to beat themselves.</p>

<p>Such a sight drew thither a curious crowd from
Rouen, and even from Paris. Yvelin, a young Parisian<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
surgeon, who had already seen the farce at Loudun,
came to see that of Louviers. He brought with him a
very clear-headed magistrate, the Commissioner of
Taxes at Rouen. They devoted unwearying attention
to the matter, settled themselves at Louviers, and
carried on their researches for seventeen days.</p>

<p>From the first day they saw into the plot. A conversation
they had had with the Penitentiary of Evreux
on their entrance into the town, was repeated back to
them by Sister Anne&#8217;s demon, as if it had been a revelation.
The scenic arrangements were very bewitching.
The shades of night, the torches, the flickering and
smoking lights, produced effects which had not been
seen at Loudun. The rest of the process was simple
enough. One of the bewitched said that in a certain
part of the garden they would find a charm. They
dug for it, and it was found. Unluckily, Yvelin&#8217;s friend,
the sceptical magistrate, never budged from the side of
the leading actress, Sister Anne. At the very edge of
a hole they had just opened he grasped her hand, and
on opening it, found the charm, a bit of black thread,
which she was about to throw into the ground.</p>

<p>The exorcisers, the penitentiary, priests, and Capuchins,
about the spot, were overwhelmed with confusion.
The dauntless Yvelin, on his own authority, began a
scrutiny, and saw to the uttermost depth of the affair.</p>

<p>Among the fifty-two nuns, said he, there were six
<i>possessed</i>, but deserving of chastisement. Seventeen
more were victims under a spell, a pack of girls upset<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
by the disease of the cloisters. He describes it with
great precision: the girls are regular but hysterical,
blown out with certain inward storms, lunatics mainly,
and disordered in mind. A nervous contagion has
ruined them; and the first thing to do is to keep them
apart.</p>

<p>He then, with the liveliness of Voltaire, examines the
tokens by which the priests were wont to recognize the
supernatural character of the bewitched. They foretel,
he allows, but only what never happens. They
translate, indeed, but without understanding; as when,
for instance, they render &#8220;<i>ex parte virginis</i>,&#8221; by &#8220;the
departure of the Virgin.&#8221; They know Greek before
the people of Louviers, but cannot speak it before the
doctors of Paris. They cut capers, take leaps of the
easiest kind, climb up the trunk of a tree which a child
three years old might climb. In short, the only thing
they do that is really dreadful and unnatural, is to use
dirtier language than men would ever do.</p>

<hr />

<p>In tearing off the mask from these people, the surgeon
rendered a great service to humanity. For the
matter was being pushed further; other victims were
about to be made. Besides the charms were found some
papers, ascribed to David or Picart, in which this and
that person were called witches, and marked out for
death. Each one shuddered lest his name should be
found there. Little by little the fear of the priesthood
made its way among the people.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span></p>

<p>The rotten age of Mazarin, the first days of the
weak Anne of Austria, were already come. Order and
government were no more. &#8220;But one phrase was left
in the language: <i>The Queen is so good.</i>&#8221; Her goodness
gave the clergy a chance of getting the upper
hand. The power of the laity entombed with Richelieu,
bishops, priests, and monks, were about to reign. The
bold impiety of the magistrate and his friend Yvelin
imperilled so sweet a hope. Groans and wailings went
forth to the Good Queen, not from the victims, but
from the knaves thus caught in the midst of their
offences. Up to the Court they went, weeping for the
outrage to their religion.</p>

<p>Yvelin was not prepared for this stroke: he deemed
himself firm at Court, having for ten years borne the
title of Surgeon to the Queen. Before he returned
from Louviers to Paris, the weakness of Anne of
Austria had been tempted into granting another commission
named by his opponents, consisting of an old
fool in his dotage, one Diafoirus of Rouen, and his
nephew, both attached to the priesthood. These did
not fail to discover that the Louviers affair was supernatural,
transcending all art of man.</p>

<p>Any other than Yvelin would have been discouraged.
The Rouen physicians treated with utter scorn this
surgeon, this barber fellow, this mere sawbones. The
Court gave him no encouragement. Still, he held on
his way in a treatise which will live yet. He accepts
this battle of science against priestcraft, declaring, as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
Wyer did in the sixteenth century, that &#8220;in all such
matters the right judge is not the priest but the man
of science.&#8221; With great difficulty he found some one
bold enough to print, but no one willing to sell his
little work. So in broad daylight the heroic young
man set about distributing it with his own hands.
Placing himself on the Pont Neuf, the most frequented
spot in Paris, at the foot of Henry the Fourth&#8217;s statue,
he gave out copies of his memoir to the passers by.
At the end of it they found a formal statement of the
shameful fraud, how in the hand of the female demons
the magistrate had caught the unanswerable evidence
of their dishonour.</p>

<hr />

<p>Return we to the wretched Madeline. Her enemy,
the Penitentiary of Evreux, by whose influence she had
been searched with needles, carried her off as his prey
to the heart of the episcopal dungeons in that town.
Below an underground passage dipped a cave, below
the cave a cell, where the poor human creature lay
buried in damps and darkness. Reckoning upon her
speedy death, her dread companions had not even the
kindness to give her a piece of linen for the dressing
of her ulcer. There, as she lay in her own filth, she
suffered alike from pain and want of cleanliness. The
whole night long she was disturbed by the running to
and fro of ravenous rats, those terrors of every prison,
who were wont to nibble men&#8217;s ears and noses.</p>

<p>But all these horrors fell short of those which her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
tyrant, the Penitentiary, dealt out to her himself. Day
after day he would come into the upper vault and speak
to her through the mouth of her pit, threatening her,
commanding her, and making her, whether she would
or no, confess to this or that crime as having been
wrought by others. At length she ceased to eat.
Fearing that she might die at once, he drew her for
a while out of her <i>In Pace</i>, and laid her in the upper
vault. Then, in his rage against Yvelin&#8217;s memoir, he
cast her back into her sewer below.</p>

<p>That glimpse of light, that short renewal and sudden
death of hope, gave the crowning impulse to her
despair. Her wound was closing, so that her strength
was greater. She was seized with a deep and violent
thirst for death. She swallowed spiders, but instead
of dying, only brought them up again. Pounded
glass she swallowed, but in vain. Finding an old bit
of sharp iron, she tried to cut her throat, but could
not. Then, as an easier way, she dug the iron into
her belly. For four hours she worked and bled, but
without success. Even this wound shortly began to
close. To crown all, the life she hated so returned to
her stronger than before. Her heart&#8217;s death was of
no avail.</p>

<p>She became once more a woman; still, alas! an
object of desire, of temptation for her jailers, those
brutish varlets of the bishopric, who, notwithstanding
the horror of the place, and the unhappy creature&#8217;s
own sad and filthy plight, would come to make sport<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
of her, believing that they might do all their pleasure
against a Witch. But an angel succoured her, so she
said. From men and rats alike she defended herself.
But against herself, herself she could not protect. Her
prison corrupted her mind. She dreamed of the Devil,
besought him to come and see her, to restore to her the
shameful pleasures in which she had wallowed at
Louviers. He never deigned to come back. Once
more amidst this corruption of her senses, she fell
back on her old desire for death. One of the jailers
had given her a drug to kill the rats. She was just
going to swallow it herself, when an angel&mdash;an angel,
was it, or a devil?&mdash;stayed her hand, reserving her
for other crimes.</p>

<p>Thenceforward&mdash;sunk into the lowest depths of vileness,
become an unspeakable cipher of cowardice and
servility&mdash;she signed endless lists of crimes which she
had never committed. Was she worth the trouble of
burning? Many had given up that idea, but the ruthless
Penitentiary clung to it still. He offered money
to a Wizard of Evreux, then in prison, if he would
bear such witness as might bring about the death of
Madeline.</p>

<p>For the future, however, they could use her for other
purposes&mdash;to bear false witness, to become a tool for
any slander. Whenever they sought the ruin of any
man, they had only to drag down to Louviers or to
Evreux this accursed ghost of a dead woman, living
only to make others die. In this way she was brought<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
out to kill with her words a poor man named Duval.
What the Penitentiary dictated to her, she repeated
readily: when he told her by what marks she should
know Duval, whom she had never seen, she pointed
him out and said she had seen him at the Sabbath.
Through her it fell out that he was burnt!</p>

<p>She owned her dreadful crime, and shuddered to
think what answer she could make before God. She
was fallen into such contempt that no one now deigned
to look after her. The doors stood wide open: sometimes
she had the keys herself. But where now should
she go, object as she was of so much dread? Thenceforth
the world repelled her&mdash;cast her out: the only
world she had left was her dungeon.</p>

<p>During the anarchy of Mazarin and his Good Lady
the chief authority remained with the Parliaments.
That of Rouen, hitherto the friendliest to the clergy,
grew wroth at last at their arrogant way of examining,
ordering, and burning people. A mere decree of the
Bishop had caused Picart&#8217;s body to be disinterred and
thrown into the common sewer. And now they were
passing on to the trial of Boull&eacute;, the curate, and supposed
abettor of Picart. Listening to the plaint of
Picart&#8217;s family, the Parliament sentenced the Bishop of
Evreux to replace him at his own expense in his tomb
at Louviers. They called up Boull&eacute;, undertook his
trial themselves, and at the same time sent for the
wretched Madeline from Evreux to Rouen.</p>

<p>People were afraid that Yvelin and the magistrate<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
who had caught the nuns in the very act of cheating,
would be made to appear. Hieing away to Paris, they
found the knave Mazarin ready to protect their knavish
selves. The whole matter was appealed to the King&#8217;s
Council&mdash;an indulgent court, without eyes or ears&mdash;whose
care it was to bury, hush up, bedarken everything
connected with justice.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, some honey-tongued priests had comforted
Madeline in her Rouen dungeon; they heard
her confessions, and enjoined her, by way of penance,
to ask forgiveness of her persecutors, the nuns of
Louviers. Thenceforth, happen what might, Madeline
could never more be brought in evidence against those
who had thus bound her fast. It was a triumph indeed
for the clergy, and the victory was sung by a
knave of an exorciser, the Capuchin Esprit de Bosroger,
in his <i>Piety Afflicted</i>, a farcical monument of
stupidity, in which he accuses, unawares, the very people
he fancies himself defending.</p>

<p>The Fronde, as I said before, was a revolution for
honest ends. Fools saw only its outer form&mdash;its
laughable aspects; but at bottom it was a serious
business, a moral reaction. In August, 1647, with the
first breath of freedom, Parliament stepped forward
and cut the knot. It ordered, in the first place, the
destruction of the Louviers Sodom; the girls were to
be dispersed and sent back to their kinsfolk. In the
next, it decreed that thenceforth the bishops of the
province should, four times a-year, send special confessors<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
to the nunneries, to ascertain that such foul
abuses were not renewed.</p>

<p>One comfort, however, the clergy were to receive.
They were allowed to burn the bones of Picart and the
living body of Boull&eacute;, who, after making public confession
in the cathedral, was drawn on a hurdle to the
Fish Market, and there, on the 21st August, 1647,
devoured by the flames. Madeline, or rather her corpse,
remained in the prisons of Rouen.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_103_103" id="Footnote_103_103"></a><a href="#FNanchor_103_103"><span class="label">[103]</span></a> It was very easy to cheat those who wished to be cheated.
By this time celibacy was harder to practise than in the Middle
Ages, the number of fasts and bloodlettings being greatly
reduced. Many died from the nervous plethora of a life so
cruelly sluggish. They made no secret of their torments,
owning them to their sisters, to their confessor, to the Virgin
herself. A pitiful thing, a thing to sorrow for, not to ridicule.
In Italy, a nun besought the Virgin for pity&#8217;s sake to grant
her a lover.</p></div>

<h3>THE DEVIL TRIUMPHS IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY.</h3>


<p class="noind"><span class="smcap">The</span> Fronde was a kind of Voltaire. The spirit of
Voltaire, old as France herself, but long restrained,
burst forth in the political, and anon in the religious,
world. In vain did the Great King seek to establish
a solemn gravity. Beneath it laughter went on.</p>

<p>Was there nought else, then, but laughter and jesting?
Nay, it was the Advent of Reason. By means
of Kepler, of Galileo, Descartes, Newton, there was
now triumphantly enthroned the reasonable dogma of
faith in the unchangeable laws of nature. Miracle
dared no longer show itself, or, when it did dare, was
hissed down. In other and better words, the fantastic
miracles of mere whim had vanished, and in their
stead was seen the mighty miracle of the universe&mdash;more
regular, and therefore more divine.</p>

<p>The great rebellion decidedly won the day. You
may see it working in the bold forms of those earlier
outbursts; in the irony of Galileo; in the absolute
doubt wherewith Descartes leads off his system. The
Middle Ages would have said, &#8220;&#8217;Tis the spirit of the
Evil One.&#8221;</p>

<p>The victory, however, is not a negative one, but very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
affirmative and surely based. The spirit of nature
and the natural sciences, those outlaws of an elder
day, return in might irresistible. All idle shadows
are hunted out by the real, the substantial.</p>

<p>They had said in their folly, &#8220;Great Pan is dead.&#8221;
Anon, observing that he was yet alive, they had made
him a god of evil: amid such a chaos they might well
be deceived. But, lo! he lives, and lives harmonious,
in the grand stability of laws that govern alike the
star and the deep-hidden mystery of life.</p>

<hr />

<p>Of this period two things, by no means contradictory,
may be averred: the spirit of Satan conquers,
while the reign of witchcraft is at an end.</p>

<p>All marvel-mongering, hellish or holy, is fallen very
sick at last. Wizards and theologians are powerless
alike. They are become, as it were, empirics, who
pray in vain for some supernatural change, some whim
of Providence, to work the wonders which science asks
of nature and reason only.</p>

<p>For all their zeal, the Jansenists of this century
succeed only in bringing forth a miracle very small
and very ridiculous. Still less lucky are the rich and
powerful Jesuits, who cannot get a miracle done at
any price; who have to be satisfied with the visions of
a hysteric girl, Sister Mary Alacoque, of an exceedingly
sanguine habit, with eyes for nothing but blood.
In view of so much impotence, magic and witchcraft
may find some solace for themselves.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span></p>

<p>While the old faith in the supernatural was thus declining,
priests and witches shared a common fate. In
the fears, the fancies of the Middle Ages, these two
were bound up together. Together they were still to
face the general laughter and disdain. When Moli&egrave;re
made fun of the Devil and his &#8220;seething cauldrons,&#8221;
the clergy were deeply stirred, deeming that the belief
in Paradise had fallen equally low.</p>

<p>A government of laymen only, that of the great
Colbert, who was long the virtual King of France,
could not conceal its scorn for such old questions. It
emptied the prisons of the wizards whom the Rouen
Parliament still crowded into them, and, in 1672, forbade
the law courts from entertaining any prosecutions
for witchcraft. The Parliament protested, and gave
people to understand that by this denial of sorcery
many other things were put in peril. Any doubting
of these lower mysteries would cause many minds to
waver from their belief in mysteries of a higher sort.</p>

<hr />

<p>The Sabbath disappears, but why? Because it
exists everywhere. It enters into the people&#8217;s habits,
becomes the practice of their daily life. The Devil,
the Witches, had long been reproached with loving
death more than life, with hating and hindering the
generative powers of nature. And now in the pious
seventeenth century, when the Witch is fast dying out,
a love of barrenness, and a fear of being fruitful, are
found to be, in very truth, the one prevalent disease.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span></p>

<p>If Satan ever read, he would have good cause for
laughter as he read the casuists who took him up
where he left off. For there was one difference at
least between them. In times of terror Satan made
provision for the famished, took pity on the poor. But
these fellows have compassion only for the rich. With
his vices, his luxury, his court life, the rich man is still
a needy miserable beggar. He comes to confession
with a humbly threatening air, in order to wrest from
his doctor permission to sin with a good conscience.
Some day will be told, by him who may have the
courage to tell it, an astounding tale of the cowardly
things done, and the shameful tricks so basely ventured
by the casuist who wished to keep his penitent.
From Navarro to Escobar the strangest bargains were
continually made at the wife&#8217;s expense, and some little
wrangling went on after that. But all this would not
do. The casuist was conquered, was altogether a
coward. From Zoccoli to Liguori&mdash;1670 to 1770&mdash;he
gave up banning Nature.</p>

<p>The Devil, so it was said, showed two countenances
at the Sabbath: the one in front seemed threatening,
the other behind was farcical. Now that he has nothing
to do with it, he has generously given the latter
to the casuist.</p>

<p>It must have amused him to see his trusty friends
settled among honest folk, in the serious households
swayed by the Church. The worldling who bettered
himself by that great resource of the day, lucrative<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
adultery, laughed at prudence, and boldly followed his
natural bent. Pious families, on the other hand, followed
nothing but their Jesuits. In order to preserve,
to concentrate their property, to leave each one wealthy
heir, they entered on the crooked ways of the new
spiritualism. Buried in a mysterious gloom, losing at
the faldstool all heed and knowledge of themselves,
the proudest of them followed the lesson taught by
Molinos: &#8220;In this world we live to suffer. But in
time that suffering is soothed and lulled to sleep by a
habit of pious indifference. We thus attain to a negation.
Death do you say? Not altogether. Without
mingling in the world, or heeding its voices, we get
thereof an echo dim and soft. It is like a windfall of
Divine Grace, so mild and searching; never more so
than in moments of self-abasement, when the will is
wholly obscured.&#8221;</p>

<p>Exquisite depths of feeling! Alas, poor Satan!
how art thou left behind! Bend low, acknowledge,
and admire thy children!</p>

<hr />

<p>The physicians who, having sprung from the popular
empiricism which men called witchcraft, were far more
truly his lawful children, were too forgetful of him
who had left them his highest patrimony, as being his
favoured heirs. They were ungrateful to the Witch,
who laid the way for themselves. Nay, they went
further than that. On this fallen king, their father
and creator, they dealt some hard strokes with the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
whip. &#8220;<i>Thou, too, my son?</i>&#8221; They gave the jesters
cruel weapons against him.</p>

<p>Even in the sixteenth century there were some to
scoff at the spirit who through all time, from the days of
the Sibyl to those of the Witch, had filled and troubled
the woman. They maintained that he was neither
God nor Devil, but only &#8220;the Prince of the Air,&#8221; as
the Middle Ages called him. Satan was nothing but
a disease!</p>

<p><i>Possession</i> to them was only a result of the prison-like,
sedentary, dry, unyielding life of the cloister. As
for the 6500 devils in Gauffridi&#8217;s little Madeline, and
the hosts that fought in the bodies of maddened nuns at
Loudun and Louviers, these doctors called them physical
storms. &#8220;If &AElig;olus can shake the earth,&#8221; said Yvelin,
&#8220;why not also the body of a girl?&#8221; La Cadi&egrave;re&#8217;s
surgeon, of whom more anon, had the coolness to say,
&#8220;it was nothing more than a choking of the womb.&#8221;</p>

<p>Wonderful descent! Routed by the simplest remedies,
by exorcisms after Moli&egrave;re, the terror of the
Middle Ages would flee away and vanish utterly!</p>

<p>This is too sweeping a reduction of the question.
Satan was more than that. The doctors saw neither
the height nor the depth of him; neither his grand
revolt in the form of science, nor that strange mixture
of impurity and pious intrigue, that union of
Tartuffe and Priapus, which he brought to pass about
the year 1700.</p>

<p>People fancy they know something about the eighteenth<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
century, and yet have never seen one of its
most essential features. The greater its outward civilization,
the clearer and fuller the light that bathed its
uppermost layers, so much the more hermetically
sealed lay all those widespread lower realms, of priests
and monks, and women credulous, sickly, prone to believe
whatever they heard or saw. In the years before
Cagliostro, Mesmer, and the magnetisers, who appeared
towards the close of the century, a good many priests
still worked away at the old dead witchcraft. They
talked of nothing but enchantments, spread the fear of
them abroad, and undertook to hunt out the devils
with their shameful exorcisms. Many set up for
wizards, well knowing how little risk they ran, now
that people were no longer burnt. They knew they
were sheltered by the milder spirit of their age, by the
tolerant teachings of their foes the philosophers, by
the levity of the great jesters, who thought that anything
could be extinguished with a laugh. Now it
was just because people laughed, that these gloomy
plot-spinners went their way without much fear. The
new spirit, that of the Regent namely, was sceptical
and easy-natured. It shone forth in the <i>Persian
Letters</i>, it shone forth everywhere in the all-powerful
journalist who filled that century, Voltaire. At any
shedding of human blood his whole heart rises indignant.
All other matters only make him laugh. Little
by little, the maxim of the worldly public seems to be,
&#8220;Punish nothing, and laugh at all.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>This tolerant spirit suffered Cardinal Tencin to appear
in public as his sister&#8217;s husband. This, too, it
was that ensured to the masters of convents the peaceful
possession of their nuns, who were even allowed to
make declarations of pregnancy, to register the births
of their children.<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> This tolerant temper made excuses
for Father Apollinaire, when he was caught in a shameful
piece of exorcism. That worthy Jesuit, Cauvrigny,
idol of the provincial convents, paid for his adventures
only by a recall to Paris, in other words&mdash;by fresh
preferment.</p>

<p>Such also was the punishment awarded the famous
Jesuit, Girard, who was loaded with honours when he
should have got the rope. He died in the sweetest
savour of holiness. His was the most curious affair of
that century. It enables us to probe the peculiar methods
of that day, to realize the coarse jumble of jarring
machinery which was then at work. As a thing of
course, it was preluded by the dangerous suavities of
the Song of Songs. It was carried on by Mary
Alacoque, with a marriage of Bleeding Hearts spiced
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>with the morbid blandishments of Molinos. To these
Girard added the whisperings of Satan and the terrors
of enchantment. He was at once the Devil and the
Devil&#8217;s exorciser. At last, horrible to say, instead of
getting justice done to her, the unhappy girl whom he
sacrificed with so much cruelty, was persecuted to
death. She disappeared, shut up perhaps by a <i>lettre
de cachet</i>, and buried alive in her tomb.</p>

<h3>FATHER GIRARD AND LA CADIERE: 1730.</h3>


<p class="noind"><span class="smcap">The</span> Jesuits were unlucky. Powerful at Versailles,
where they ruled the Court, they had not the slightest
credit with Heaven. Not one tiny miracle could they
do. The Jansenists overflowed, at any rate, with
touching stories of miracles done. Untold numbers
of sick, infirm, halt, and paralytic obtained a momentary
cure at the tomb of the Deacon P&acirc;ris. Crushed by a
terrible succession of plagues, from the time of the
Great King to the Regency, when so many were reduced
to beggary, these unfortunate people went to
entreat a poor, good fellow, a virtuous imbecile, a
saint in spite of his absurdities, to make them whole.
And what need, after all, of laughter? His life is far
more touching than ridiculous. We are not to be
surprised if these good folk, in the emotion of seeing
their benefactor&#8217;s tomb, suddenly forgot their own
sufferings. The cure did not last, but what matter?
A miracle indeed had taken place, a miracle of devotion,
of lovingkindness, of gratitude. Latterly, with
all this some knavery began to mingle, but at that
time, in 1728, these wonderful popular scenes were
very pure.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span></p>

<p>The Jesuits would have given anything for the least
of the miracles they denied. For well-nigh fifty years
they worked away, embellishing with fables and anecdotes
their Legend of the Sacred Heart, the story of
Mary Alacoque. For twenty-five or thirty years they
had been trying to convince the world that their helpmate,
James II. of England, not content with healing
the king&#8217;s evil (in his character of King of France),
amused himself after his death in making the dumb to
speak, the lame to walk straight, and the squint-eyed
to see properly. They who were cured squinted worse
than ever. As for the dumb, it so chanced that she
who played this part was a manifest rogue, caught in
the very act of stealing. She roamed the provinces:
at every chapel of any renowned saint she was healed
by a miracle and received alms, and then began her
work again elsewhere.</p>

<p>For getting wonders wrought the South was a better
country. There might be found a plenty of nervous
women, easy to excite, the very ones to make into
somnambulists, subjects of miracle, bearers of mystic
marks, and so forth.</p>

<p>At Marseilles the Jesuits had on their side a bishop,
Belzunce, a bold, hearty sort of man, renowned in the
memorable plague,<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> but credulous and narrow-minded
withal; under whose countenance many a bold venture
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>might be made. Beside him they had placed a Jesuit
of Franche-Comt&eacute;, not wanting in mind, whose austere
outside did not prevent his preaching pleasantly, in
an ornate and rather worldly style, such as the ladies
loved. A true Jesuit, he made his way by two different
methods, now by feminine intrigue, anon by his
holy utterances. Girard had on his side neither years
nor figure; he was a man of forty-seven, tall, withered,
weak-looking, of dirty aspect, and given to spitting
without end.<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> He had long been a tutor, even till he
was thirty-seven; and he preserved some of his college
tastes. For the last ten years, namely, ever since the
great plague, he had been confessor to the nuns. With
them he had fared well, winning over them a high
degree of power by enforcing a method seemingly
quite at variance with the Provencial temperament, by
teaching the doctrine and the discipline of a mystic
death, of absolute passiveness, of entire forgetfulness
of self. The dreadful crisis through which they had
just passed had deadened their spirits, and weakened
hearts already unmanned by a kind of morbid languor.
Under Girard&#8217;s leading, the Carmelites of Marseilles
carried their mysticism to great lengths; and first
among them was Sister Remusat, who passed for a
saint.</p>

<p>In spite, or perhaps by reason, of this success, the
Jesuits took Girard away from Marseilles: they wanted
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>to employ him in raising anew their house at Toulon.
Colbert&#8217;s splendid institution, the Seminary for Naval
Chaplains, had been entrusted to the Jesuits, with the
view of cleansing the young chaplains from the influence
of the Lazarists, who ruled them almost everywhere.
But the two Jesuits placed in charge were
men of small capacity. One was a fool; the other,
Sabatier, remarkable, in spite of his age, for heat of
temper. With all the insolence of our old navy he
never kept himself under the least control. In
Toulon he was reproached, not for having a mistress,
nor yet a married woman, but for intriguing in a way
so insolent and outrageous as to drive the husband
wild. He sought to keep the husband specially alive
to his own shame, to make him wince with every kind
of pang. Matters were pushed so far that at last the
husband died outright.</p>

<p>Still greater was the scandal caused by the Jesuits&#8217;
rivals, the Observantines, who, having spiritual charge
of a sisterhood at Ollioules, made mistresses openly of
the nuns, and, not content with this, dared even to
seduce the little boarders. One Aubany, the Father
Guardian, violated a girl of thirteen; when her parents
pursued him, he found shelter at Marseilles.</p>

<p>As Director of the Seminary for Chaplains, Girard
began, through his seeming sternness and his real
dexterity, to win for the Jesuits an ascendant over
monks thus compromised, and over parish-priests of
very vulgar manners and scanty learning.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span></p>

<p>In those Southern regions, where the men are abrupt,
not seldom uncouth of speech and appearance, the
women have a lively relish for the gentle gravity of the
men of the North: they feel thankful to them for
speaking a language at once aristocratic, official, and
French.</p>

<p>When Girard reached Toulon, he must already have
gained full knowledge of the ground before him.
Already had he won over a certain Guiol, who sometimes
came to Marseilles, where she had a daughter, a
Carmelite nun. This Guiol, wife of a small carpenter,
threw herself entirely into his hands, even more so
than he wanted. She was of ripe age, extremely vehement
for a woman of forty-seven, depraved and ready
for anything, ready to do him service of whatever kind,
no matter what he might do or be, whether he were a
sinner or a saint.</p>

<p>This Guiol, besides her Carmelite daughter at Marseilles,
had another, a lay-sister to the Ursulines of
Toulon. The Ursulines, an order of teaching nuns,
formed everywhere a kind of centre; their parlour, the
resort of mothers, being a half-way stage between the
cloister and the world. At their house, and doubtless
through their means, Girard saw the ladies of the
town, among them one of forty years, a spinster, Mdlle.
Gravier, daughter of an old contractor for the royal
works at the Arsenal. This lady had a shadow who
never left her, her cousin La Reboul, daughter of a
skipper and sole heiress to herself; a woman, too, who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
really meant to succeed her, though very nearly
her own age, being five-and-thirty. Around these
gradually grew a small roomful of Girard&#8217;s admirers,
who became his regular penitents. Among them were
sometimes introduced a few young girls, such as
La Cadi&egrave;re, a tradesman&#8217;s daughter and herself a
sempstress, La Laugier, and La Batarelle, the daughter
of a waterman. They had godly readings together,
and now and then small suppers. But they were
specially interested in certain letters which recounted
the miracles and ecstacies of Sister Remusat, who was
still alive; her death occurring in February, 1730.
What a glorious thing for Father Girard, who had led
her to a pitch so lofty! They read, they wept, they
shouted with admiration. If they were not ecstatic
yet, they were not far from being so. Already, to
please her kinswoman, would La Reboul throw herself
at times into a strange plight by holding her breath
and pinching her nose.</p>

<hr />

<p>Among these girls and women the least frivolous
certainly was Catherine Cadi&egrave;re, a delicate, sickly girl
of seventeen, taken up wholly with devotion and
charity, of a mournful countenance, which seemed to
say that, young as she was, she had felt more keenly
than anyone else the great misfortunes of the time,
those, namely, of Provence and Toulon. This is easily
explained. She was born during the frightful famine
of 1709; and just as the child was growing into a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
maiden, she witnessed the fearful scenes of the great
plague. Those two events seemed to have left their
mark upon her, to have taken her out of the present
into a life beyond.</p>

<p>This sad flower belonged wholly to Toulon, to the
Toulon of that day. To understand her better we
must remember what that town is and what it was.</p>

<p>Toulon is a thoroughfare, a landing-place, the entrance
of an immense harbour and a huge arsenal.
The sense of this carries the traveller away, and prevents
his seeing Toulon itself. There is a town however
there, indeed an ancient city. It contains two
different sets of people, the stranger functionaries, and
the genuine Toulonnese, who are far from friendly to
the former, regarding them with envy, and often
roused to rebellion by the swaggering of the naval
officers. All these differences were concentred in the
gloomy streets of a town in those days choked up
within its narrow girdle of fortifications. The most
peculiar feature about this small dark town is, that it
lies exactly between two broad seas of light, between
the marvellous mirror of its roadstead and its glorious
amphitheatre of mountains, baldheaded, of a dazzling
grey, that blinds you in the noonday sun. All the
gloomier look the streets themselves. Such as do not
lead straight to the harbour and draw some light
therefrom, are plunged at all hours in deep gloom.
Filthy byeways, and small tradesmen with shops ill-furnished,
invisible to anyone coming for the day,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
such is the general aspect of the place. The interior
forms a maze of passages in which you may find plenty
of churches, and old convents now turned into barracks.
Copious kennels, laden and foul with sewage
water, run down in torrents. The air is almost stagnant,
and in so dry a climate you are surprised at
seeing so much moisture.</p>

<p>In front of the new theatre a passage called La
Rue de l&#8217;H&ocirc;pital leads from the narrow Rue Royale
into the narrow Rue des Cannoniers. It might almost
be called a blind alley. The sun, however, just looks
down upon it at noon, but, finding the place so dismal,
passes on forthwith, and leaves the passage to its
wonted darkness.</p>

<p>Among these gloomy dwellings the smallest was that
of the Sister Cadi&egrave;re, a retail dealer, or huckster.
There was no entrance but by the shop, and only one
room on each floor. The Cadi&egrave;res were honest pious
folk, and Madame Cadi&egrave;re the mirror of excellence
itself. These good people were not altogether poor.
Besides their small dwelling in the town, they too,
like most of their fellow-townsmen, had a country-house
of their own. This latter is, commonly, a
mere hut, a little stony plot of ground yielding a
little wine. In the days of its naval greatness, under
Colbert and his son, the wondrous bustle in the harbour
brought some profit to the town. French money
flowed in. The many great lords who passed that
way brought their households along with them, an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
army of wasteful domestics, who left a good many
things behind them. All this came to a sudden end.
The artificial movement stopped short: even the
workmen at the arsenal could no longer get their
wages; shattered vessels were left unrepaired; and at
last the timbers themselves were sold.</p>

<p>Toulon was keenly sensible of the rebound. At
the siege of 1707 it seemed as if dead. What, then,
was it in the dreadful year 1709, the 71st of Louis
XIV., when every plague at once, a hard winter, a
famine, and an epidemic, seemed bent on utterly destroying
France? The very trees of Provence were
not spared. All traffic came to an end. The roads
were covered with starving beggars. Begirt with
bandits who stopped up every outlet, Toulon quaked
for fear.</p>

<p>To crown all, Madame Cadi&egrave;re, in this year of
sorrow, was with child. Three boys she had borne
already. The eldest stayed in the shop to help his
father. The second was with the Friar Preachers, and
destined to become a Dominican, or a Jacobin as they
were then called. The third was studying in the
Jesuit seminary as a priest to be. The wedded couple
wanted a daughter; Madame prayed to Heaven for a
saint. She spent her nine months in prayer, fasting,
or eating nought but rye bread. She had a daughter,
namely Catherine. The babe was very delicate and,
like her brothers, unhealthy. The dampness of an
ill-aired dwelling, and the poor nourishment gained<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
from a mother so thrifty and more than temperate, had
something to do with this. The brothers had scrofulous
glands, and in her earlier years the little thing
suffered from the same cause. Without being altogether
ill, she had all the suffering sweetness of a sickly
child. She grew up without growing stronger. At
an age when other children have all the strength and
gladness of upswelling life in them, she was already
saying, &#8220;I have not long to live.&#8221;</p>

<p>She took the small-pox, which left her rather marked.
I know not if she was handsome, but it is clear that
she was very winning, with all the charming contrasts,
the twofold nature of the maidens of Provence. Lively
and pensive, gay and sad, by turns, she was a good
little worshipper, but given to harmless pranks withal.
Between the long church services, if she went into the
country with girls of her own age, she made no fuss
about doing as they did, but would sing and dance
away and flourish her tambourine. But such days
were few. Most times her chief delight was to climb
up to the top of the house, to bring herself nearer
heaven, to obtain a glimpse of daylight, to look out,
perhaps, on some small strip of sea, or some pointed
peak in the vast wilderness of hills. Thenceforth to
her eyes they were serious still, but less unkindly than
before, less bald and leafless, in a garment thinly
strewn with arbutus and larch.</p>

<p>This dead town of Toulon numbered 26,000 inhabitants
when the plague began. It was a huge<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
throng cooped up in one spot. But from this centre
let us take away a girdle of great convents with their
backs upon the ramparts, convents of Minorites,
Ursulines, Visitandines, Bernardines, Oratorians,
Jesuits, Capuchins, Recollects; those of the Refuge,
the Good Shepherd, and, midmost of all, the enormous
convent of Dominicans. Add to these the parish
churches, parsonages, bishop&#8217;s palace, and it seems
that the clergy filled up the place, while the people
had no room at all, to speak of.<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a></p>

<p>On a centre so closely thronged, we may guess how
savagely the plague would fasten. Toulon&#8217;s kind heart
was also to prove her bane. She received with generous
warmth some fugitives from Marseilles. These are just
as likely to have brought the plague with them, as certain
bales of wool to which was traced the first appearance
of that scourge. The chief men of the place were
about to fly, to scatter themselves over the country.
But the First Consul, M. d&#8217;Antrechaus, a man of heroic
soul, withheld them, saying, with a stern air, &#8220;And
what will the people do, sirs, in this impoverished town,
if the rich folk carry their purses away?&#8221; So he held
them back, and compelled all persons to stay where
they were. Now the horrors of Marseilles had been
ascribed to the mutual intercourse of its inhabitants.
D&#8217;Antrechaus, however, tried a system entirely the
reverse, tried to isolate the people of Toulon, by shutting
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>them up in their houses. Two huge hospitals
were established, in the roadstead and in the hills. All
who did not come to these, had to keep at home on
pain of death. For seven long months D&#8217;Antrechaus
carried out a wager, which would have been held impossible,
the keeping, namely, and feeding in their own
houses, of a people numbering 26,000 souls. All that
time Toulon was one vast tomb. No one stirred save
in the morning, to deal out bread from door to door,
and then to carry off the dead. Most of the doctors
perished, and the magistrates all but D&#8217;Antrechaus.
The gravediggers also perished, and their places were
filled by condemned deserters, who went to work with
brutal and headlong violence. Bodies were thrown into
the tumbril, head downwards, from the fourth storey.
One mother, having just lost her little girl, shrunk
from seeing her poor wee body thus hurled below, and
by dint of bribing, managed to get it lowered the
proper way. As they were bearing it off, the child
came to; it lived still. They took her up again, and
she survived, to become the grandmother of the learned
M. Brun, who wrote an excellent history of the port.</p>

<p>Poor little Cadi&egrave;re was exactly the same age as this
girl who died and lived again, being twelve years old,
an age for her sex so full of danger. In the general
closing of the churches, in the putting down of all
holidays, and chiefly of Christmas, wont to be so merry
a season at Toulon, the child&#8217;s fancy saw the end of all
things. It seems as though she never quite shook off<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
that fancy. Toulon never raised her head again. She
retained her desert-like air. Everything was in ruins,
everyone in mourning; widowers, orphans, desperate
beings were everywhere seen. In the midst, a mighty
shadow, moved D&#8217;Antrechaus himself; he had seen all
about him perish, his sons, his brothers, and his colleagues;
and was now so gloriously ruined, that he was
fain to look to his neighbours for his daily meals. The
poor quarrelled among themselves for the honour of
feeding him.</p>

<p>The young girl told her mother that she would never
more wear any of her smarter clothes, and she must,
therefore, sell them. She would do nothing but wait
upon the sick, and she was always dragging her to the
hospital at the end of the street. A little neighbour-girl
of fourteen, Laugier by name, who had lost her
father, was living with her mother in great wretchedness.
Catherine was continually going to them with
food and clothes, and anything she could get for them.
She begged her parents to defray the cost of
apprenticing Laugier to a dressmaker; and such was
her sway over them that they could not refuse to incur
so heavy an outlay. Her piety, her many little charms
of soul, rendered her all-powerful. She was impassioned
in her charity, giving not alms only, but love as
well. She longed to make Laugier perfect, rejoiced to
have her by her side, and often gave her half her bed.
The pair had been admitted among the <i>Daughters of
Saint Theresa</i>, the third order established by the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
Carmelites. Mdlle. Cadi&egrave;re was their model nun, and
seemed at thirteen a Carmelite complete. Already she
devoured some books of mysticism borrowed from a
Visitandine. In marked contrast with herself seemed
Laugier, now a girl of fifteen, who would do nothing
but eat and look handsome. So indeed she was, and
on that account had been made sextoness to the chapel
of Saint Theresa. This led her into great familiarities
with the priests, and so, when her conduct called for
her expulsion from the congregation, another authority,
the vicar-general, flew into such a rage as to declare
that, if she were expelled, the chapel itself would be
interdicted.</p>

<p>Both these girls had the temperament of their
country, suffering from great excitement of the nerves,
and from what was called flatulence of the womb. But
in each the result was entirely different; being very
carnal in the case of Laugier, who was gluttonous, lazy,
passionate; but wholly cerebral with regard to the pure
and gentle Catherine, who owing to her ailments or to
a lively imagination that took everything up into itself,
had no ideas concerning sex. &#8220;At twenty she was like
a child of seven.&#8221; For nothing cared she but praying
and giving of alms; she had no wish at all to marry.
At the very word &#8220;marriage,&#8221; she would fall a-weeping,
as if she had been asked to abandon God.</p>

<p>They had lent her the life of her patroness, Catherine
of Genoa, and she had bought for herself <i>The Castle of
the Soul</i>, by St. Theresa. Few confessors could follow<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
her in these mystic flights. They who spoke clumsily
of such things gave her pain. She could not keep
either her mother&#8217;s confessor, the cathedral-priest, or
another, a Carmelite, or even the old Jesuit Sabatier.
At sixteen she found a priest of Saint Louis, a highly
spiritual person. She spent days in church, to such a
degree that her mother, by this time a widow and
often in want of her, had to punish her, for all her
own piety, on her return home. It was not the girl&#8217;s
fault, however: during her ecstasies she quite forgot
herself. So great a saint was she accounted by the
girls of her own age, that sometimes at mass they
seemed to see the Host drawn on by the moving
power of her love, until it flew up and placed itself of
its own accord in her mouth.</p>

<p>Her two young brothers differed from each other in
their feelings towards Girard. The elder, who lived
with the Friar Preachers, shared the natural dislike of
all Dominicans for the Jesuit. The other, who was
studying with the Jesuits in order to become a priest,
regarded Girard as a great man, a very saint, a man to
honour as a hero. Of this younger brother, sickly
like herself, Catherine was very fond. His ceaseless
talking about Girard was sure to do its work upon
her. One day she met the father in the street. He
looked so grave, but so good and mild withal, that a
voice within her said, &#8220;Behold the man to whose
guidance thou art given!&#8221; The next Saturday, when
she came to confess to him, he said that he had been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
expecting her. In her amazed emotion she never
dreamed that her brother might have given him
warning, but fancied that the mysterious voice had
spoken to him also, and that they two were sharing the
heavenly communion of warnings from the world
above.</p>

<p>Six months of summer passed away, and yet Girard,
who confessed her every Saturday, had taken no step
towards her. The scandal about old Sabatier had set
him on his guard. His own prudence would have
held him to an attachment of a darker kind for such a
one as the Guiol, who was certainly very mature, but
also ardent and a devil incarnate.</p>

<p>It was Cadi&egrave;re who made the first advances towards
him, innocent as they were. Her brother, the giddy
Jacobin, had taken it into his head to lend a lady and
circulate through the town a satire called <i>The Morality
of the Jesuits</i>. The latter were soon apprised of this.
Sabatier swore that he would write to the Court for a
sealed order (lettre-de-cachet) to shut up the Jacobin.
In her trouble and alarm, his sister, with tears in her
eyes, went to beseech Father Girard for pity&#8217;s sake to
interfere. On her coming again to him a little later,
he said, &#8220;Make yourself easy; your brother has
nothing to fear; I have settled the matter for him.&#8221;
She was quite overcome. Girard saw his advantage.
A man of his influence, a friend of the King, a friend of
Heaven as well, after such proof of goodness as he had
just been giving, would surely have the very strongest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
sway over so young a heart! He made the venture,
and in her own uncertain language said to her, &#8220;Put
yourself in my hands; yield yourself up to me altogether.&#8221;
Without a blush she answered, in the fulness
of her angelic purity, &#8220;Yes;&#8221; meaning nought else
than to have him for her sole director.</p>

<p>What were his plans concerning her? Would he
make her a mistress or the tool of his charlatanry?
Girard doubtless swayed to and fro, but he leant, I
think, most towards the latter idea. He had to make
his choice, might manage to seek out pleasures free
from risk. But Mdlle. Cadi&egrave;re was under a pious
mother. She lived with her family, a married brother
and the two churchmen, in a very confined house, whose
only entrance lay through the shop of the elder
brother. She went no whither except to church.
With all her simplicity she knew instinctively what
things were impure, what houses dangerous. The
Jesuit penitents were fond of meeting together at the
top of a house, to eat, and play the fool, and cry out, in
their Provencial tongue, &#8220;Vivent les <i>Jesuitons</i>!&#8221; A
neighbour, disturbed by their noise, went and found
them lying on their faces, singing and eating fritters,
all paid for, it was said, out of the alms-money. Cadi&egrave;re
was also invited, but taking a disgust to the
thing she never went a second time.</p>

<p>She was assailable only through her soul. And
it was only her soul that Girard seemed to desire.
That she should accept those lessons of passive faith<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
which he had taught at Marseilles, this apparently was
all his aim. Hoping that example would do more for
him than precept, he charged his tool Guiol to escort
the young saint to Marseilles, where lived the friend of
Cadi&egrave;re&#8217;s childhood, a Carmelite nun, a daughter of
Guiol&#8217;s. The artful woman sought to win her trust by
pretending that she, too, was sometimes ecstatic. She
crammed her with absurd stories. She told her, for
instance, that on finding a cask of wine spoilt in her
cellar, she began to pray, and immediately the wine
became good. Another time she felt herself pierced by
a crown of thorns, but the angels had comforted her by
serving up a good dinner, of which she partook with
Father Girard.</p>

<p>Cadi&egrave;re gained her mother&#8217;s leave to go with this
worthy Guiol to Marseilles, and Madame Cadi&egrave;re paid
her expenses. It was now the most scorching month&mdash;that
of August, 1729&mdash;in a scorching climate, when
the country was all dried up, and the eye could see
nothing but a rugged mirror of rocks and flintstone.
The weak, parched brain of a sick girl suffering from the
fatigues of travel, was all the more easily impressed by
the dismal air of a nunnery of the dead. The true
type of this class was the Sister Remusat, already a
corpse to outward seeming, and soon to be really dead.
Cadi&egrave;re was moved to admire so lofty a piece of perfection.
Her treacherous companion allured her with
the proud conceit of being such another and filling her
place anon.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span></p>

<p>During this short trip of hers, Girard, who remained
amid the stifling heats of Toulon, had met with a dismal
fall. He would often go to the girl Laugier, who
believed herself to be ecstatic, and &#8220;comfort&#8221; her to
such good purpose that he got her presently with
child. When Mdlle. Cadi&egrave;re came back in the highest
ecstasy, as if like to soar away, he for his part was
become so carnal, so given up to pleasure, that he &#8220;let
fall on her ears a whisper of love.&#8221; Thereat she took
fire, but all, as anyone may see, in her own pure, saintly,
generous way; as eager to keep him from falling, as
devoting herself even to die for his sake.</p>

<p>One of her saintly gifts was her power of seeing
into the depths of men&#8217;s hearts. She had sometimes
chanced to learn the secret life and morals of her confessors,
to tell them of their faults; and this, in their
fear and amazement, many of them had borne with
great humility. One day this summer, on seeing
Guiol come into her room, she suddenly said, &#8220;Wicked
woman! what have you been doing?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And she was right,&#8221; said Guiol herself, at a later
period; &#8220;for I had just been doing an evil deed.&#8221;
Perhaps she had just been rendering Laugier the same
midwife&#8217;s service which next year she wished to render
Batarelle.</p>

<p>Very likely, indeed, Laugier had entrusted to Catherine,
at whose house she often slept, the secret of
her good fortune, the love, the fatherly caresses of her
saint. It was a hard and stormy trial for Catherine&#8217;s<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
spirits. On the one side, she had learnt by heart
Girard&#8217;s maxim, that whatever a saint may do is holy.
But on the other hand, her native honesty and the
whole course of her education compelled her to believe
that over-fondness for the creature was ever a mortal
sin. This woeful tossing between two different doctrines
quite finished the poor girl, brought on within
her dreadful storms, until at last she fancied herself
possessed with a devil.</p>

<p>And here her goodness of heart was made manifest.
Without humbling Girard, she told him she had a
vision of a soul tormented with impure thoughts and
deadly sin; that she felt the need of rescuing that
soul, by offering the Devil victim for victim, by agreeing
to yield herself into his keeping in Girard&#8217;s stead.
He never forbade her, but gave her leave to be possessed
for one year only.</p>

<p>Like the rest of the town, she had heard of the
scandalous loves of Father Sabatier&mdash;an insolent passionate
man, with none of Girard&#8217;s prudence. The
scorn which the Jesuits&mdash;to her mind, such pillars of
the Church&mdash;were sure to incur, had not escaped her
notice. She said one day to Girard, &#8220;I had a vision
of a gloomy sea, with a vessel full of souls tossed by
a storm of unclean thoughts. On this vessel were
two Jesuits. Said I to the Redeemer, whom I saw in
heaven, &#8216;Lord, save them, and let me drown! The
whole of their shipwreck do I take upon myself,&#8217; And
God, in His mercy, granted my prayer.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>All through the trial, and when Girard, become her
foe, was aiming at her death, she never once recurred
to this subject. These two parables, so clear in meaning,
she never explained. She was too high-minded
to say a word about them. She had doomed herself to
very damnation. Some will say that in her pride she
deemed herself so deadened and impassive as to defy
the impurity with which the Demon troubled a man of
God. But it is quite clear that she had no accurate
knowledge of sensual things, foreseeing nought in
such a mystery save pains and torments of the Devil.
Girard was very cold, and quite unworthy of all this
sacrifice. Instead of being moved to compassion, he
sported with her credulity through a vile deceit. Into
her casket he slipped a paper, in which God declared
that, for her sake, He would indeed save the vessel.
But he took care not to leave so absurd a document
there: she would have read it again and again
until she came to perceive how spurious it was. The
angel who brought the paper carried it off the next
day.</p>

<p>With the same coarseness of feeling Girard lightly
allowed her, all unsettled and incapable of praying as
she plainly was, to communicate as much as she pleased
in different churches every day. This only made her
worse. Filled already with the Demon, she harboured
the two foes in one place. With equal power they
fought within her against each other. She thought
she would burst asunder. She would fall into a dead<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
faint, and so remain for several hours. By December
she could not move even from her bed.</p>

<p>Girard had now but too good a plea for seeing her.
He was prudent enough to let himself be led by the
younger brother at least as far as her door. The sick
girl&#8217;s room was at the top of the house. Her mother
stayed discreetly in the shop. He was left alone as
long as he pleased, and if he chose could turn the key.
At this time she was very ill. He handled her
as a child, drawing her forward a little to the front of the
bed, holding her head, and kissing her in a fatherly
way.</p>

<p>She was very pure, but very sensitive. A slight
touch, that no one else would have remarked, deprived
her of her senses: this Girard found out for himself,
and the knowledge of it possessed him with evil
thoughts. He threw her at will into this trance,<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> and
she, in her thorough trust in him, never thought of
trying to prevent it, feeling only somewhat troubled
and ashamed at causing such a man to waste upon her
so much of his precious time. His visits were very
long. It was easy to foresee what would happen at
last. Ill as she was, the poor girl inspired Girard with
a passion none the less wild and uncontrollable. One
freedom led to another, and her plaintive remonstrances
were met with scornful replies. &#8220;I am your master&mdash;your
god. You must bear all for obedience sake.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>At length, about Christmas-time, the last barrier of
reserve was broken down; and the poor girl awoke
from her trance to utter a wail which moved even him
to pity.</p>

<p>An issue which she but dimly realized, Girard, as
better enlightened, viewed with growing alarm. Signs
of what was coming began to show themselves in her
bodily health. To crown the entanglement, Laugier
also found herself with child. Those religious meetings,
those suppers watered with the light wine of the
country, led to a natural raising of the spirits of a race
so excitable, and the trance that followed spread from
one to another. With the more artful all this was
mere sham; but with the sanguine, vehement Laugier
the trance was genuine enough. In her own little
room she had real fits of raving and swooning, especially
when Girard came in. A little later than Cadi&egrave;re she,
too became fruitful.</p>

<p>The danger was great. The girls were neither in a
desert nor in the heart of a convent, but rather, as one
might say, in the open street: Laugier in the midst
of prying neighbours, Cadi&egrave;re in her own family.
The latter&#8217;s brother, the Jacobin, began to take
Girard&#8217;s long visits amiss. One day when Girard
came, he ventured to stay beside her as though to
watch over her safety. Girard boldly turned him out
of the room, and the mother angrily drove her son
from the house.</p>

<p>This was very like to bring on an explosion. Of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
course, the young man, swelling with rage at this hard
usage, at this expulsion from his home, would cry
aloud to the Preaching Friars, who in their turn would
seize so fair an opening, to go about repeating the
story and stirring up the whole town against the
Jesuit. The latter, however, resolved to meet them
with a strangely daring move, to save himself by a
crime. The libertine became a scoundrel.</p>

<p>He knew his victim, had seen the scrofulous traces
of her childhood, traces healed up but still looking
different from common scars. Some of these were on
her feet, others a little below her bosom. He formed
a devilish plan of renewing the wounds and passing
them off as &#8220;<i>stigmata</i>,&#8221; like those procured from
heaven by St. Francis and other saints, who sought
after the closest conformity with their pattern, the
crucified Redeemer, even to bearing on themselves
the marks of the nails and the spear-wound in the
side. The Jesuits were distressed at having nought
to show against the miracles of the Jansenists. Girard
felt sure of pleasing them by an unlooked-for miracle.
He could not but receive the support of his own order,
of their house at Toulon. One of them, old Sabatier,
was ready to believe anything: he had of yore been
Cadi&egrave;re&#8217;s confessor, and this affair would bring him
into credit. Another of these was Father Grignet, a
pious old dotard, who would see whatever they pleased.
If the Carmelites or any others were minded to have
their doubts, they might be taught, by warnings from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
a high quarter, to consult their safety by keeping
silence. Even the Jacobin Cadi&egrave;re, hitherto a stern
and jealous foe, might find his account in turning
round and believing in a tale which made his family
illustrious and himself the brother of a saint.</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; some will say, &#8220;did not the thing come
naturally? We have instances numberless, and well-attested,
of persons really marked with the sacred
wounds.&#8221;</p>

<p>The reverse is more likely. When she was aware
of the new wounds, she felt ashamed and distressed
with the fear of displeasing Girard by this return of
her childish ailments; for such she deemed the sores
which he had opened afresh while she lay unconscious
in the trance. So she sped away to a neighbour, one
Madame Truc, who dabbled in physic, and of her she
bought, as if for her youngest brother, an ointment to
burn away the sores.</p>

<p>She would have thought herself guilty of a great sin,
if she had not told everything to Girard. So, however
fearful she might be of displeasing and disgusting
him, she spoke of this matter also. Looking at the
wounds, he began playing his comedy, rebuked her
attempt to heal them, and thus set herself against God.
They were the marks, he said, of Heaven. Falling on
his knees, he kissed the wounds on her feet. She
crossed herself in self-abasement, struggled long-time
against such a belief. Girard presses and scolds,
makes her show him her side, and looks admiringly at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
the wound. &#8220;I, too,&#8221; he said, &#8220;have a wound;
but mine is within.&#8221;</p>

<p>And now she is fain to believe in herself as a living
miracle. Her acceptance of a thing so startling was
greatly quickened by the fact, that Sister Remusat was
just then dead. She had seen her in glory, her heart
borne upward by the angels. Who was to take her
place on earth? Who should inherit her high gifts,
the heavenly favours wherewith she had been crowned?
Girard offered her the succession, corrupting her
through her pride.</p>

<p>From that time she was changed. In her vanity
she set down every natural movement within her as
holy. The loathings, the sudden starts of a woman
great with child, of all which she knew nothing, were
accounted for as inward struggles of the Spirit. As
she sat at table with her family on the first day of
Lent, she suddenly beheld the Saviour, who said, &#8220;I
will lead thee into the desert, where thou shalt share
with Me all the love and all the suffering of the holy
Forty Days.&#8221; She shuddered for dread of the suffering
she must undergo. But still she would offer up
her single self for a whole world of sinners. Her
visions were all of blood; she had nothing but blood
before her eyes. She beheld Jesus like a sieve running
blood. She herself began to spit blood, and lose it in
other ways. At the same time her nature seemed
quite changed. The more she suffered, the more
amorous she grew. On the twentieth day of Lent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
she saw her name coupled with that of Girard. Her
pride, raised and quickened by these new sensations,
enabled her to comprehend the <i>special sway</i> enjoyed
by Mary, the Woman, with respect to God. She felt
<i>how much lower angels are</i> than the least of saints,
male or female. She saw the Palace of Glory, and
mistook herself for the Lamb. To crown these illusions
she felt herself lifted off the ground, several feet into
the air. She could hardly believe it, until Mdlle.
Gravier, a respectable person, assured her of the fact.
Everyone came, admired, worshipped. Girard brought
his colleague Grignet, who knelt before her and wept
with joy.</p>

<p>Not daring to go to her every day, Girard often made
her come to the Jesuits&#8217; Church. There, before the
altar, before the cross, he surrendered himself to a
passion all the fiercer for such a sacrilege. Had she
no scruples? did she still deceive herself? It seems as
if, in the midst of an elation still unfeigned and earnest,
her conscience was already dazed and darkened.
Under cover of her bleeding wounds, those cruel favours
of her heavenly Spouse, she began to feel some curious
compensations....</p>

<p>In her reveries there are two points especially touching.
One is the pure ideal she had formed of a faithful
union, when she fancied that she saw her name
and that of Girard joined together for ever in the Book
of Life. The other is her kindliness of heart, the
charmingly childlike nature which shines out through<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
all her extravagances. On Palm Sunday, looking at
the joyous party around their family table, she wept
three hours together, for thinking that &#8220;on that very
day no one had asked Jesus to dinner.&#8221;</p>

<p>Through all that Lent, she could hardly eat anything:
the little she took was thrown up again. The last
fifteen days she fasted altogether, until she reached the
last stage of weakness. Who would have believed that
against this dying girl, to whom nothing remained but
the mere breath, Girard could practise new barbarities?
He had kept her sores from closing. A new one was
now formed on her right side. And at last, on Good
Friday, he gave the finishing touch to his cruel
comedy, by making her wear a crown of iron-wire,
which pierced her forehead, until drops of blood rolled
down her face. All this was done without much
secresy. He began by cutting off her long hair and
carrying it away. He ordered the crown of one
Bitard, a cagemaker in the town. She did not show
herself to her visitors with the crown on: they saw
the result only, the drops of blood and the bleeding
visage. Impressions of the latter, like so many <i>Veronicas</i>,<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a>
were taken off on napkins, and doubtless given
away by Girard to people of great piety.</p>

<p>The mother, in her own despite, became an abettor
in all this juggling. In truth, she was afraid of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>Girard; she began to find him capable of anything,
and somebody, perhaps the Guiol, had told her, in the
deepest confidence, that, if she said a word against him,
her daughter would not be alive twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>Cadi&egrave;re, for her part, never lied about the matter.
In the narrative taken down from her own lips of
what happened this Lent, she expressly tells of a
crown, with sharp points, which stuck in her head, and
made it bleed. Nor did she then make any secret of
the source whence came the little crosses she gave her
visitors. From a model supplied by Girard, they were
made to her order by one of her kinsfolk, a carpenter
in the Arsenal.</p>

<p>On Good Friday, she remained twenty-four hours in
a swoon, which they called a trance; remained in
special charge of Girard, whose attentions weakened
her, and did her deadly harm. She was now three
months gone with child. The saintly martyr, the
transfigured marvel, was already beginning to fill out.
Desiring, yet dreading the more violent issues of
a miscarriage, he plied her daily with reddish powders
and dangerous drinks.</p>

<p>Much rather would he have had her die, and so have
rid himself of the whole business. At any rate, he
would have liked to get her away from her mother, to
bury her safe in a convent. Well acquainted with
houses of that sort, he knew, as Picard had done in the
Louviers affair, how cleverly and discreetly such cases
as Cadi&egrave;re&#8217;s could be hidden away. He talked of it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
this very Good Friday. But she seemed too weak to
be taken safely from her bed. At last, however, four
days after Easter, a miscarriage took place.</p>

<p>The girl Laugier had also been having strange
convulsive fits, and absurd beginnings of <i>stigmata</i>:
one of them being an old wound, caused by her
scissors when she was working as a seamstress, the
other an eruptive sore in her side. Her transports
suddenly turned to impious despair. She spat upon
the crucifix: she cried out against Girard, &#8220;that devil
of a priest, who had brought a poor girl of two-and-twenty
into such a plight, only to forsake her afterwards!&#8221;
Girard dared not go and face her passionate
outbreaks. But the women about her, being all in
his interest, found some way of bringing this matter
to a quiet issue.</p>

<p>Was Girard a wizard, as people afterwards maintained?
They might well think so, who saw how
easily, being neither young nor handsome, he had
charmed so many women. Stranger still it was, that
after getting thus compromised, he swayed opinion to
such a degree. For a while, he seemed to have
enchanted the whole town.</p>

<p>The truth was, that everyone knew the strength of
the Jesuits. Nobody cared to quarrel with them. It
was hardly reckoned safe to speak ill of them, even in
a whisper. The bulk of the priesthood consisted of
monklings of the Mendicant orders, who had no
powerful friends or high connections. The Carmelites<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
themselves, jealous and hurt as they were at losing
Cadi&egrave;re, kept silence. Her brother, the young Jacobin,
was lectured by his trembling mother into resuming
his old circumspect ways. Becoming reconciled to
Girard, he came at length to serve him as devotedly
as did his younger brother, even lending himself to a
curious trick by which people were led to believe that
Girard had the gift of prophecy.</p>

<hr />

<p>Such weak opposition as he might have to fear,
would come only from the very person whom he seemed
to have most thoroughly mastered. Submissive hitherto,
Cadi&egrave;re now gave some slight tokens of a coming
independence which could not help showing itself. On
the 30th of April, at a country party got up by the
polite Girard, and to which he sent his troop of young
devotees in company with Guiol, Cadi&egrave;re fell into deep
thought. The fair spring-time, in that climate so very
charming, lifted her heart up to God. She exclaimed
with a feeling of true piety, &#8220;Thee, Thee only, do I
seek, O Lord! Thine angels are not enough for me.&#8221;
Then one of the party, a blithesome girl, having, in the
Provencial fashion, hung a tambourine round her neck,
Cadi&egrave;re skipped and danced about like the rest; with
a rug thrown across her shoulders, she danced the
Bohemian measure, and made herself giddy with a
hundred mad capers.</p>

<p>She was very unsettled. In May she got leave from
her mother to make a trip to Sainte-Baume, to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
Church of St. Mary Magdalen, the chief saint of girls
on penance. Girard would only let her go under
charge of two faithful overlookers, Guiol and Reboul.
But though she had still some trances on the way, she
showed herself weary of being a passive tool to the
violent spirit, whether divine or devilish, that annoyed
her. The end of her year&#8217;s <i>possession</i> was not far off.
Had she not won her freedom? Once issued forth
from the gloom and witcheries of Toulon, into the open
air, in the midst of nature, beneath the full sunshine,
the prisoner regained her soul, withstood the stranger
spirit, dared to be herself, to use her own will.
Girard&#8217;s two spies were far from edified thereat. On
their return from this short journey, from the 17th
to the 22nd May, they warned him of the change.
He was convinced of it from his own experience. She
fought against the trance, seeming no longer wishful
to obey aught save reason.</p>

<p>He had thought to hold her both by his power of
charming and through the holiness of his high office,
and, lastly, by right of possession and carnal usage.
But he had no hold upon her at all. The youthful
soul, which, after all, had not been so much conquered
as treacherously surprised, resumed its own nature.
This hurt him. Besides his business of pedant, his
tyranny over the children he chastised at will, over
nuns not less at his disposal, there remained within
a hard bottom of domineering jealousy. He determined
to snatch Cadi&egrave;re back by punishing this first<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
little revolt, if such a name could be given to the
timid fluttering of a soul rising again from its long
compression. On the 22nd May she confessed to
him after her wont; but he refused to absolve her,
declaring her to be so guilty that on the morrow
he would have to lay upon her a very great penance
indeed.</p>

<p>What would that be? A fast? But she was weakened
and wasted already. Long prayers, again, were
not in fashion with Quietist directors,&mdash;were in fact
forbidden. There remained the <i>discipline</i>, or bodily
chastisement. This punishment, then everywhere
habitual, was enforced as prodigally in convents as in
colleges. It was a simple and summary means of
swift execution, sometimes, in a rude and simple age,
carried out in the churches themselves. The <i>Fabliaux</i>
show us an artless picture of manners, where, after confessing
husband and wife, the priest gave them the
discipline without any ceremony, just as they were,
behind the confessional. Scholars, monks, nuns, were
all punished in the same way.<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span></p>
<p>Girard knew that a girl like Cadi&egrave;re, all unused to
shame, and very modest&mdash;for what she had hitherto
suffered took place unknown to herself in her sleep&mdash;would
feel so cruelly tortured, so fatally crushed by
this unseemly chastisement, as utterly to lose what
little buoyancy she had. She was pretty sure too, if
we must speak out, to be yet more cruelly mortified
than other women, in respect of the pang endured by
her woman&#8217;s vanity. With so much suffering, and so
many fasts, followed by her late miscarriage, her body,
always delicate, seemed worn away to a shadow. All
the more surely would she shrink from any exposure
of a form so lean, so wasted, so full of aches. Her
swollen legs and such-like small infirmities would serve
to enhance her humiliation.</p>

<p>We lack the courage to relate what followed. It
may all be read in those three depositions, so artless,
so manifestly unfeigned, in which, without being
sworn, she made it her duty to avow what self-interest
bade her conceal, owning even to things which were
afterwards turned to the cruellest account against
her.</p>

<p>Her first deposition was made on the spur of the
moment, before the spiritual judge who was sent to
take her by surprise. In this we seem to be ever
hearing the utterances of a young heart that speaks as
though in God&#8217;s own presence. The second was taken
before the King&mdash;I should rather say before the magistrate
who represented him, the Lieutenant Civil and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
Criminal of Toulon. The last was heard before the
great assembly of the Parliament of Aix.</p>

<p>Observe that all three, agreeing as they do wonderfully
together, were printed at Aix under the eye of
her enemies, in a volume where, as I shall presently
prove, an attempt was made to extenuate the guilt of
Girard, and fasten the reader&#8217;s gaze on every point
likely to tell against Cadi&egrave;re. And yet the editor
could not help inserting depositions like these, which
bear with crushing weight on the man he sought to
uphold.</p>

<p>It was a monstrous piece of inconsistency on Girard&#8217;s
part. He first frightened the poor girl, and then
suddenly took a base, a cruel advantage of her fears.</p>

<p>In this case no plea of love can be offered in extenuation.
The truth is far otherwise: he loved her
no more. And this forms the most dreadful part of
the story. We have seen how cruelly he drugged her;
we have now to see her utterly forsaken. He owed her
a grudge for being of greater worth than those other
degraded women. He owed her a grudge for having
unwittingly tempted him and brought him into danger.
Above all, he could not forgive her for keeping her
soul in safety. He sought only to tame her down, but
caught hopefully at her oft-renewed assurance, &#8220;I feel
that I shall not live.&#8221; Villanous profligate that he
was, bestowing his shameful kisses on that poor
shattered body whose death he longed to see!</p>

<p>How did he account to her for this shocking<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
antagonism of cruelty and caresses? Was it meant
to try her patience and obedience, or did he boldly
pass on to the true depths of Molinos&#8217; teaching, that
&#8220;only by dint of sinning can sin be quelled&#8221;? Did
she take it all in full earnest, never perceiving that all
this show of justice, penitence, expiation, was downright
profligacy and nothing else?</p>

<p>She did not care to understand him in the strange
moral crash that befell her after that 23rd May, under
the influence of a mild warm June. She submitted to
her master, of whom she was rather afraid, and with a
singularly servile passion carried on the farce of undergoing
small penances day by day. So little regard did
Girard show for her feelings that he never hid from
her his relations with other women. All he wanted
was to get her into a convent. Meanwhile she was
his plaything: she saw him, let him have his way.
Weak, and yet further weakened by the shame that
unnerved her, growing sadder and more sad at heart,
she had now but little hold on life, and would keep on
saying, in words that brought no sorrow to Girard&#8217;s
soul, &#8220;I feel that I shall soon be dead.&#8221;</p>

<h3>CADIERE IN THE CONVENT: 1730.</h3>


<p class="noind"><span class="smcap">The</span> Abbess of the Ollioules Convent was young for an
abbess, being only thirty-eight years old. She was
not wanting in mind. She was lively, swift alike in
love and in hatred, hurried away by her heart and her
senses also, endowed with very little of the tact and
the moderation needed for the governing of such a
body.</p>

<p>This nunnery drew its livelihood from two sources.
On the one side, there came to it from Toulon two or
three nuns of consular families, who brought good
dowers with them, and therefore did what they
pleased. They lived with the Observantine monks who
had the ghostly direction of the convent. On the
other hand, these monks, whose order had spread to
Marseilles and many other places, picked up some
little boarders and novices who paid for their keep: a
contact full of danger and unpleasantness for the
children, as one may see by the Aubany affair.</p>

<p>There was no real confinement, nor much internal
order. In the scorching summer nights of that
African climate, peculiarly oppressive and wearying in
the airless passes of Ollioules, nuns and novices went<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
to and fro with the greatest freedom. The very same
things were going on at Ollioules in 1730 which we
saw in 1630 at Loudun. The bulk of nuns, well-nigh
a dozen out of the fifteen who made up the house,
being rather forsaken by the monks, who preferred
ladies of loftier position, were poor creatures, sick at
heart, and disinherited, with nothing to console them
but tattling, child&#8217;s play, and other school-girls&#8217; tricks.</p>

<p>The abbess was afraid that Cadi&egrave;re would soon see
through all this. She made some demur about taking
her in. Anon, with some abruptness, she entirely
changed her cue. In a charming letter, all the more
flattering as sent so unexpectedly from such a lady to
so young a girl, she expressed a hope of her leaving
the ghostly guidance of Father Girard. The girl
was not, of course, to be transferred to her Observantines,
who were far from capable of the charge.
The abbess had formed the bold, enlivening idea of
taking her into her own hands and becoming her sole
director.</p>

<p>She was very vain. Deeming herself more agreeable
than an old Jesuit confessor, she reckoned on
making this prodigy her own, on conquering her without
trouble. She would have worked the young saint
for the benefit of her house.</p>

<p>She paid her the marked compliment of receiving
her on the threshold, at the street-door. She kissed
her, caught her up, led her into the abbess&#8217;s own fine
room, and bade her share it with herself. She was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
charmed with her modesty, with her invalid grace,
with a certain strangeness at once mysterious and melting.
In that short journey the girl had suffered a
great deal. The abbess wanted to lay her down in
her own bed, saying she loved her so that she would
have them sleep together like sisters in one bed.</p>

<p>For her purpose this was probably more than was
needful. It would have been quite enough to have the
saint under her own roof. She would now have too
much the look of a little favourite. The lady, however,
was surprised at the young girl&#8217;s hesitation,
which doubtless sprang from her modesty or her
humility; in part, perhaps, from a comparison of her
own ill-health with the young health and blooming
beauty of the other. But the abbess tenderly urged
her request.</p>

<p>Under the influence of a fondling so close and so
continual, she deemed that Girard would be forgotten.
With all abbesses it had become the ruling fancy, the
pet ambition, to confess their own nuns, according to
the practice allowed by St. Theresa. By this pleasant
scheme of hers the same result would come out of
itself, the young woman telling her confessors only
of small things, but keeping the depths of her heart
for one particular person. Caressed continually by
one curious woman, at eventide, in the night, when
her head was on the pillow, she would have let out
many a secret, whether her own or another&#8217;s.</p>

<p>From this living entanglement she could not free<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
herself at the first. She slept with the abbess. The
latter thought she held her fast by a twofold tie, by
the opposite means employed on the saint and on the
woman; that is, on the nervous, sensitive, and, through
her weakness, perhaps sensual girl. Her story, her
sayings, whatever fell from her lips, were all written
down. From other sources she picked up the meanest
details of her physical life, and forwarded the report
thereof to Toulon. She would have made her an idol,
a pretty little pet doll. On a slope so slippery the
work of allurement doubtless moved apace. But the
girl had scruples and a kind of fear. She made one
great effort, of which her weak health would have
made her seem incapable. She humbly asked leave
to quit that dove&#8217;s-nest, that couch too soft and delicate,
to go and live in common with the novices or the
boarders.</p>

<p>Great was the abbess&#8217;s surprise; great her mortification.
She fancied herself scorned. She took a
spite against the thankless girl, and never forgave her.</p>

<hr />

<p>From the others Cadi&egrave;re met with a very pleasant
welcome. The mistress of the novices, Madame de
Lescot, a nun from Paris, refined and good, was a
worthier woman than the abbess. She seemed to
understand the other&mdash;to see in her a poor prey of fate,
a young heart full of God, but cruelly branded by
some eccentric spell which seemed like to hurry her onward
to disgrace, to some unhappy end. She busied herself<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
entirely with looking after the girl, saving her from
her own rashness, interpreting her to others, excusing
those things which might in her be least excusable.</p>

<p>Saving the two or three noble ladies who lived with
the monks and had small relish for the higher mysticism,
they were all fond of her, and took her for an
angel from heaven. Their tender feelings having little
else to engage them, became concentred in her and
her alone. They found her not only pious and wonderfully
devout, but a good child withal, kind-hearted,
winning, and entertaining. They were no longer listless
and sick at heart. She engaged and edified them
with her dreams, with stories true, or rather, perhaps,
unfeigned, mingled ever with touches of purest tenderness.
She would say, &#8220;At night I go everywhere,
even to America. Everywhere I leave letters bidding
people repent. To-night I shall go and seek you out,
even when you have locked yourselves in. We will all
go together into the Sacred Heart.&#8221;</p>

<p>The miracle was wrought. Each of them at midnight,
so she said, received the delightful visit. They
all fancied they felt Cadi&egrave;re embracing them, and
making them enter the heart of Jesus. They were
very frightened and very happy. Tenderest, most
credulous of all, was Sister Raimbaud, a woman of
Marseilles, who tasted this happiness fifteen times in
three months, or nearly once in every six days.</p>

<p>It was purely the effect of imagination. The proof
is, that Cadi&egrave;re visited all of them at one same moment.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
The abbess meanwhile was hurt, being roused
at the first to jealousy by the thought that she only
had been left out, and afterwards feeling assured that,
lost as the girl might be in her own dreams, she would
get through so many intimate friends but too clear an
inkling into the scandals of the house.</p>

<p>These were scarcely hidden from her at all. But as
nothing came to Cadi&egrave;re save by the way of spiritual
insight, she fancied they had been told her in a revelation.
Here her kindliness shone out. She felt a large
compassion for the God who was thus outraged. And
once again she imagined herself bound to atone for the
rest, to save the sinners from the punishment they deserved,
by draining herself the worst cruelties which
the rage of devils would have power to wreak.</p>

<p>All this burst upon her on the 25th June, the
Feast of St. John. She was spending the evening with
the sisters in the novices&#8217; rooms. With a loud cry she
fell backward in contortions, and lost all consciousness.</p>

<p>When she came to, the novices surrounded her, waiting
eager to hear what she was going to say. But the
governess, Madame Lescot, guessed what she would
say, felt that she was about to ruin herself. So she
lifted her up, and led her straight to her room, where
she found herself quite flayed, and her linen covered
with blood.</p>

<p>Why did Girard fail her amidst these struggles inward
and from without? She could not make him
out. She had much need of support, and yet he never<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
came, except for one moment at rare intervals, to the
parlour.</p>

<p>She wrote to him on the 28th June, by her brothers;
for though she could read, she was scarcely
able to write. She called to him in the most stirring,
the most urgent tones, and he answers by putting her
off. He has to preach at Hy&egrave;res, he has a sore throat,
and so on.</p>

<p>Wonderful to tell, it is the abbess herself who brings
him thither. No doubt she was uneasy at Cadi&egrave;re&#8217;s
discovering so much of the inner life of the convent.
Making sure that the girl would talk of it to Girard,
she wished to forestal her. In a very flattering and
tender note of the 3rd July, she besought the Jesuit
to come and see herself first, for she longed, between
themselves, to be his pupil, his disciple, as humble
Nicodemus had been of Christ. &#8220;Under your guidance,
by the blessing of that holy freedom which my post
ensures me, I should move forward swiftly and noiselessly
in the path of virtue. The state of our young
candidate here will serve me as a fair and useful pretext.&#8221;</p>

<p>A startling, ill-considered step, betraying some unsoundness
in the lady&#8217;s mind. Having failed to supplant
Girard with Cadi&egrave;re, she now essayed to supplant
Cadi&egrave;re with Girard. Abruptly, without the least preface,
she stepped forward. She made her decision, like
a great lady, who was still agreeable and quite sure of
being taken at her word, who would go so far as even
to talk of the <i>freedom</i> she enjoyed!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span></p>

<p>In taking so false a step she started from a true belief
that Girard had ceased to care much for Cadi&egrave;re.
But she might have guessed that he had other things
to perplex him in Toulon. He was disturbed by an
affair no longer turning upon a young girl, but on a
lady of ripe age, easy circumstances, and good standing;
on his wisest penitent, Mdlle. Gravier. Her forty years
failed to protect her. He would have no self-governed
sheep in his fold. One day, to her surprise and mortification,
she found herself pregnant, and loud was
her wail thereat.</p>

<p>Taken up with this new adventure, Girard looked
but coldly on the abbess&#8217;s unforeseen advances. He
mistrusted them as a trap laid for him by the Observantines.
He resolved to be cautious, saw the abbess,
who was already embarrassed by her rash step, and
then saw Cadi&egrave;re, but only in the chapel where he
confessed her.</p>

<p>The latter was hurt by his want of warmth. In
truth his conduct showed strange inconsistencies. He
unsettled her with his light, agreeable letters, full of
little sportive threats which might have been called
lover-like. And yet he never deigned to see her save
in public.</p>

<p>In a note written the same evening she revenged
herself in a very delicate way. She said that when
he granted her absolution, she felt wonderfully dissevered
both from herself and from <i>every other
creature</i>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span></p>

<p>It was just what Girard would have wanted. His
plots had fallen into a sad tangle, and Cadi&egrave;re was in
the way. Her letter enchanted him: far from being
annoyed with her, he enjoined her to keep dissevered.
At the same time, he hinted at the need he had for
caution. He had received a letter, he said, warning
him sharply of her faults. However, as he would set
off on the 6th July for Marseilles, he would see
her on the road.</p>

<p>She awaited him, but no Girard came. Her agitation
was very great. It brought on a sharp fit of her
old bodily distemper. She spoke of it to her dear
Sister Raimbaud, who would not leave her, who slept
with her, against the rules. This was on the night of
the 6th July, when the heat in that close oven of
Ollioules was most oppressive and condensed. At four
or five o&#8217;clock, seeing her writhe in sharp suffering,
the other &#8220;thought she had the colic, and went to
fetch some fire from the kitchen.&#8221; While she was
gone, Cadi&egrave;re tried by one last effort to bring Girard
to her side forthwith. Whether with her nails she
had re-opened the wounds in her head, or whether she
had stuck upon it the sharp iron crown, she somehow
made herself all bloody. The pain transfigured her,
until her eyes sparkled again.</p>

<p>This lasted not less than two hours. The nuns
flocked to see her in this state, and gazed admiringly.
They would even have brought their Observantines
thither, had Cadi&egrave;re not prevented them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span></p>

<p>The abbess would have taken good care to tell
Girard nothing, lest he should see her in a plight so
touching, so very pitiful. But good Madame Lescot
comforted the girl by sending the news to the father.
He came, but like a true juggler, instead of going up
to her room at once, had himself an ecstatic fit in the
chapel, staying there a whole hour on his knees, prostrate
before the Holy Sacrament. Going at length
upstairs, he found Cadi&egrave;re surrounded by all the nuns.
They tell him how for a moment she looked as if she
was at mass, how she seemed to open her lips to receive
the Host. &#8220;Who should know that better than
myself?&#8221; said the knave. &#8220;An angel had told me.
I repeated the mass, and gave her the sacrament from
Toulon.&#8221; They were so upset by the miracle, that
one of them was two days ill. Girard then addressed
Cadi&egrave;re with unseemly gaiety: &#8220;So, so, little glutton!
would you rob me of half my share?&#8221;</p>

<p>They withdraw respectfully, leaving these two alone.
Behold him face to face with his bleeding victim, so
pale, so weak, but agitated all the more! Anyone
would have been greatly moved. The avowal expressed
by her blood, her wounds, rather than spoken words,
was likely to reach his heart. It was a humbling
sight; but who would not have pitied her? This
innocent girl could for one moment yield to
nature! In her short unhappy life, a stranger as she
was to the charms of sense, the poor young saint could
still show one hour of weakness! All he had hitherto<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
enjoyed of her without her knowledge, became mere
nought. With her soul, her will, he would now be
master of everything.</p>

<p>In her deposition Cadi&egrave;re briefly and bashfully
said that she lost all knowledge of what happened
next. In a confession made to one of her friends she
uttered no complaints, but let her understand the
truth.</p>

<p>And what did Girard do in return for so charmingly
bold a flight of that impatient heart? He scolded
her. He was only chilled by a warmth which would
have set any other heart on fire. His tyrannous soul
wanted nothing but the dead, the merest plaything of
his will. And this girl, by the boldness of her first
move, had forced him to come. The scholar had
drawn the master along. The peevish pedant treated
the matter as he would have treated a rebellion at
school. His lewd severities, his coolly selfish pursuit
of a cruel pleasure, blighted the unhappy girl, who
now had nothing left her but remorse.</p>

<p>It was no less shocking a fact, that the blood poured
out for his sake had no other effect than to tempt him
to make the most of it for his own purposes. In this,
perhaps his last, interview he sought to make so far
sure of the poor thing&#8217;s discretion, that, however
forsaken by him, she herself might still believe in
him. He asked if he was to be less favoured than
the nuns who had seen the miracle. She let herself
bleed before him. The water with which he washed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
away the blood he drank himself,<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> and made her
drink also, and by this hateful communion, he thought
to bind fast her soul.</p>

<p>This lasted two or three hours, and it was now near
noon. The abbess was scandalized. She resolved to
go with the dinner herself, and make them open the
door. Girard took some tea: it being Friday, he
pretended to be fasting; though he had doubtless
armed himself well at Toulon. Cadi&egrave;re asked for
coffee. The lay sister who managed the kitchen was
surprised at this on such a day. But without that
strengthening draught she would have fainted away.
It set her up a little, and she kept hold of Girard
still. He stayed with her, no longer indeed locked
in, till four o&#8217;clock, seeking to efface the gloomy impression
caused by his conduct in the morning. By
dint of lying about friendship and fatherhood, he
somewhat reassured the susceptible creature, and
calmed her troubled spirits. She showed him the
way out, and, walking after him, took, childlike, two
or three skips for joy. He said, drily, &#8220;Little fool!&#8221;</p>

<hr />

<p>She paid heavily for her weakness. At nine of
that same night she had a dreadful vision, and was
heard crying out, &#8220;O God! keep off from me! get
back!&#8221; On the morning of the 8th, at mass she
did not stay for the communion, deeming herself, no
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>doubt, unworthy, but made her escape to her own
room. Thereon arose much scandal. Yet so greatly
was she beloved, that one of the nuns ran after her,
and, telling a compassionate falsehood, swore she had
beheld Jesus giving her the sacrament with His own
hand.</p>

<p>Madame Lescot delicately and cleverly wrote a legend
out of the mystic ejaculations, the holy sighs, the
devout tears, and whatever else burst forth from this
shattered heart. Strange to say, these women tenderly
conspired to shield a woman. Nothing tells more
than this in behalf of poor Cadi&egrave;re and her delightful
gifts. Already in one month&#8217;s time she had become
the child of all. They defended her in everything she
did. Innocent though she might be, they saw in her
only the victim of the Devil&#8217;s attacks. One kind sturdy
woman of the people, Matherone, daughter of the
Ollioules locksmith, and porteress herself to the convent,
on seeing some of Girard&#8217;s indecent liberties,
said, in spite of them, &#8220;No matter: she is a saint.&#8221;
And when he once talked of taking her from the
convent, she cried out, &#8220;Take away our Mademoiselle
Cadi&egrave;re! I will have an iron door made to keep her
from going.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alarmed at the state of things, and at the use to
which it might be turned by the abbess and her monks,
Cadi&egrave;re&#8217;s brethren who came to her every day, took
courage to be beforehand; and in a formal letter
written in her name to Girard, reminded him of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
revelation given to her on the 25th June regarding
the morals of the Observantines. It was time, they
said, &#8220;to carry out God&#8217;s purposes in this matter,&#8221;
namely, of course, to demand an inquiry, to accuse
the accusers.</p>

<p>Their excess of boldness was very rash. Cadi&egrave;re,
now all but dying, had no such thoughts in her head.
Her women-friends imagined that he who had caused
the disturbance would, perhaps, bring back the calm.
They besought Girard to come and confess her. A
dreadful scene took place. At the confessional she
uttered cries and wailings audible thirty paces off. The
curious among them found some amusement listening
to her, and were not disappointed. Girard was inflicting
chastisement. Again and again he said, &#8220;Be
calm, mademoiselle!&#8221; In vain did he try to absolve
her. She would not be absolved. On the 12th, she
had so sharp a pang below her heart, that she felt as
though her sides were bursting. On the 14th, she
seemed fast dying, and her mother was sent for. She
received the viaticum; and on the morrow made a
public confession, &#8220;the most touching, the most expressive
that had ever been heard. We were drowned
in tears.&#8221; On the 20th, she was in a state of heart-rending
agony. After that she had a sudden and
saving change for the better, marked by a very soothing
vision. She beheld the sinful Magdalen pardoned,
caught up into glory, filling in heaven the place which
Lucifer had lost.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span></p>

<p>Girard, however, could only ensure her discretion
by corrupting her yet further, by choking her remorse.
Sometimes he would come to the parlour and greet
her with bold embraces. But oftener he sent his
faithful followers, Guiol and others, who sought to
initiate her into their own disgraceful secrets, while
seeming to sympathise tenderly with the sufferings of
their outspoken friend. Girard not only winked at
this, but himself spoke freely to Cadi&egrave;re of such matters
as the pregnancy of Mdlle. Gravier. He wanted her
to ask him to Ollioules, to calm his irritation, to
persuade him that such a circumstance might be a
delusion of the Devil&#8217;s causing, which could perchance
be dispelled.</p>

<p>These impure teachings made no way with Cadi&egrave;re.
They were sure to anger her brethren, to whom they
were not unknown. The letters they wrote in her name
are very curious. Enraged at heart and sorely wounded,
accounting Girard a villain, but obliged to make
their sister speak of him with respectful tenderness,
they still, by snatches, let their wrath become visible.</p>

<p>As for Girard&#8217;s letters, they are pieces of laboured
writing, manifestly meant for the trial which might
take place. Let us talk of the only one which he did
not get into his hands to tamper with. It is dated
the 22nd July. It is at once sour and sweet, agreeable,
trifling, the letter of a careless man. The meaning of
it is thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;The bishop reached Toulon this morning, and will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
go to see Cadi&egrave;re.... They will settle together what
to do and say. If the Grand Vicar and Father Sabatier
wish to see her, and ask to see her wounds, she
will tell them that she has been forbidden to do or
say aught.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am hungering to see you again, to see the whole
of you. You know that I only demand <i>my right</i>. It
is so long since I have seen more than half of you (he
means to say, at the parlour grating). Shall I tire
you? Well, do you not also tire me?&#8221; And so on.</p>

<p>A strange letter in every way. He distrusts alike
the bishop and the Jesuit, his own colleague, old
Sabatier. It is at bottom the letter of a restless
culprit. He knows that in her hands she holds his
letters, his papers, the means, in short, of ruining him.
The two young men write back in their sister&#8217;s name a
spirited answer&mdash;the only one that has a truthful sound.
They answer him line for line, without insult, but
with a roughness often ironical, and betraying the
wrath pent-up within them. The sister promises to
obey him, to say nothing either to the bishop or the
Jesuit. She congratulates him on having &#8220;boldness
enough to exhort others to suffer.&#8221; She takes up
and returns him his shocking gallantry, but in a
shocking way; and here we trace a man&#8217;s hand, the
hand of those two giddy heads.</p>

<p>Two days after, they went and told her to decide on
leaving the convent forthwith. Girard was dismayed.
He thought his papers would disappear with her.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
The greatness of his terror took away his senses. He
had the weakness to go and weep at the Ollioules
parlour, to fall on his knees before her, and ask her if
she had the heart to leave him. Touched by his words,
the poor girl said &#8220;No,&#8221; went forward, and let him embrace
her. And yet this Judas wanted only to deceive
her, to gain a few days&#8217; time for securing help from a
higher quarter.</p>

<p>On the 29th there is an utter change. Cadi&egrave;re
stays at Ollioules, begs him to excuse her, vows submission.
It is but too clear that he has set some
mighty influences at work; that from the 29th threats
come in, perhaps from Aix, and presently from Paris.
The Jesuit bigwigs have been writing, and their courtly
patrons from Versailles.</p>

<p>In such a struggle, what were the brethren to do?
No doubt they took counsel with their chiefs, who
would certainly warn them against setting too hard on
Girard as a <i>libertine confessor</i>; for thereby offence
would be given to all the clergy, who deemed confession
their dearest prize. It was needful, on the contrary;
to sever him from the priests by proving the
strangeness of his teaching, by bringing him forward
as a <i>Quietist</i>. With that one word they might lead
him a long way. In 1698, a vicar in the neighbourhood
of Dijon had been burnt for Quietism. They
conceived the idea of drawing up a memoir, dictated
apparently by their sister, to whom the plan was really
unknown, in which the high and splendid Quietism of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
Girard should be affirmed, and therefore in effect
denounced. This memoir recounted the visions she
had seen in Lent. In it the name of Girard was
already in heaven. She saw it joined with her own
in the Book of Life.</p>

<p>They durst not take this memoir to the bishop.
But they got their friend, little Camerle, his youthful
chaplain, to steal it from them. The bishop read it,
and circulated some copies about the town. On the
21st August, Girard being at the palace, the bishop
laughingly said to him, &#8220;Well, father, so your name
is in the Book of Life!&#8221;</p>

<p>He was overcome, fancied himself lost, wrote to
Cadi&egrave;re in terms of bitter reproach. Once more with
tears he asked for his papers. Cadi&egrave;re in great surprise
vowed that her memoir had never gone out of
her brother&#8217;s hands. But when she found out her
mistake, her despair was unbounded. The sharpest
pangs of body and soul beset her. Once she thought
herself on the point of death. She became like one
mad. &#8220;I long so much to suffer. Twice I caught
up the rod of penance, and wielded it so savagely as
to draw a great deal of blood.&#8221; In the midst of this
dreadful outbreak, which proved at once the weakness
of her head and the boundless tenderness of her conscience,
Guiol finished her by describing Girard as
nearly dead. This raised her compassion to the
highest pitch.</p>

<p>She was going to give up the papers. And yet it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
was but too clear that these were her only safeguard
and support, the only proofs of her innocence, and the
tricks of which she had been made the victim. To
give them up was to risk a change of characters, to
risk the imputation of having herself seduced a saint,
the chance, in short, of seeing all the blame transferred
to her own side.</p>

<p>But, if she must either be ruined herself or else ruin
Girard, she would far sooner accept the former result.
A demon, Guiol of course, tempted her in this very
way, with the wondrous sublimity of such a sacrifice.
God, she wrote, asked of her a bloody offering. She
could tell her of saints who, being accused, did not
justify, but rather accused themselves, and died like
lambs. This example Cadi&egrave;re followed. When Girard
was accused before her, she defended him, saying,
&#8220;He is right, and I told a falsehood.&#8221;</p>

<p>She might have yielded up the letters of Girard
only; but in so great an outflowing of heart she
would have no haggling, and so gave him even copies
of her own.</p>

<p>Thus at the same time he held these drafts
written by the Jacobin, and the copies made and sent
him by the other brother. Thenceforth he had nothing
to fear: no further check could be given him.
He might make away with them or put them back
again; might destroy, blot out, and falsify at pleasure.
He was perfectly free to carry on his forger&#8217;s work,
and he worked away to some purpose. Out of twenty-four<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
letters, sixteen remain; and these still read like
elaborately forged afterthoughts.</p>

<p>With everything in his own hands, Girard could
laugh at his foes. It was now their turn to be afraid.
The bishop, a man of the upper world, was too well
acquainted with Versailles and the name won by the
Jesuits not to treat them with proper tenderness. He
even thought it safest to make Girard some small amends
for his unkind reproach about The Book of Life; and
so he graciously informed him that he would like to
stand godfather to the child of one of his kinsmen.</p>

<p>The Bishops of Toulon had always been high lords.
The list of them shows all the first names of Provence,
and some famous names from Italy. From
1712 to 1737, under the Regency and Fleury, the
bishop was one of the La Tours of Pin. He was
very rich, having also the Abbeys of Aniane and
St. William of the Desert, in Languedoc. He behaved
well, it was said, during the plague of 1721.
However, he stayed but seldom at Toulon, lived quite
as a man of the world, never said mass, and passed
for something more than a lady&#8217;s man.</p>

<p>In July he went to Toulon, and though Girard
would have turned him aside from Ollioules and
Cadi&egrave;re, he was curious to see her nevertheless. He
saw her in one of her best moments. She took his
fancy, seemed to him a pretty little saint; and so far
did he believe in her enlightenment from above, as to
speak to her thoughtlessly of all his affairs, his interests,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
his future doings, consulting her as he would
have consulted a teller of fortunes.</p>

<p>In spite, however, of the brethren&#8217;s prayers he
hesitated to take her away from Ollioules and from
Girard. A means was found of resolving him. A
report was spread about Toulon, that the girl had
shown a desire to flee into the wilderness, as her
model saint, Theresa, had essayed to do at twelve years
old. Girard, they said, had put this fancy into her
head, that he might one day carry her off beyond the
diocese whose pride she was, and box-up his treasure
in some far convent, where the Jesuits, enjoying the
whole monopoly, might turn to the most account her
visions, her miracles, her winsome ways as a young
saint of the people. The bishop felt much hurt. He
instructed the abbess to give Mdlle. Cadi&egrave;re up to no
one save her mother, who was certain to come very
shortly and take her away from the convent to a
country-house belonging to the family.</p>

<p>In order not to offend Girard, they got Cadi&egrave;re to
write and say that, if such a change incommoded him,
he could find a colleague and give her a second
confessor. He saw their meaning, and preferred disarming
jealousy by abandoning Cadi&egrave;re. He gave
her up on the 15th September, in a note most carefully
worded and piteously humble, by which he strove to
leave her friendly and tender towards himself. &#8220;If I
have sometimes done wrong as concerning you, you
will never at least forget how wishful I have been to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
help you.... I am, and ever will be, all yours in
the Secret Heart of Jesus.&#8221;</p>

<p>The bishop, however, was not reassured. He fancied
that the three Jesuits, Girard, Sabatier, and
Grignet, wanted to beguile him, and some day, with
some order from Paris, rob him of his little woman.
On the 17th September, he decided once for all to
send his carriage, a light fashionable <i>phaeton</i>, as it was
called, and have her taken off at once to her mother&#8217;s
country-house.</p>

<p>By way of soothing and shielding her, of putting
her in good trim, he looked out for a confessor, and
applied first to a Carmelite who had confessed her
before Girard came. But he, being an old man,
declined. Some others also probably hung back. The
bishop had to take a stranger, but three months come
from the County (Avignon), one Father Nicholas,
prior of the Barefooted Carmelites. He was a man of
forty, endowed with brains and boldness, very firm
and even stubborn. He showed himself worthy of
such a trust by rejecting it. It was not the Jesuits he
feared, but the girl herself. He foreboded no good
therefrom, thought that the angel might be an angel
of darkness, and feared that the Evil One under the
shape of a gentle girl would deal his blows with all
the more baleful effect.</p>

<p>But he could not see her without feeling somewhat
reassured. She seemed so very simple, so pleased
at length to have a safe, steady person, on whom she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
might lean. The continual wavering in which she
had been kept by Girard, had caused her the greatest
suffering. On the first day she spoke more than she
had done for a month past, told him of her life, her
sufferings, her devotions, and her visions. Night
itself, a hot night in mid-September, did not stop her.
In her room everything was open, the windows, and
the three doors. She went on even to daybreak, while
her brethren lay near her asleep. On the morrow she
resumed her tale under the vine-bower. The Carmelite
was amazed, and asked himself if the Devil
could ever be so earnest in praise of God.</p>

<p>Her innocence was clear. She seemed a nice
obedient girl, gentle as a lamb, frolicsome as a puppy.
She wanted to play at bowls, a common game in those
country-places, nor did he for his part refuse to
join her.</p>

<p>If there was a spirit in her, it could not at any rate
be called the spirit of lying. On looking at her closely
for a long time, you could not doubt that her wounds
now and then did really bleed. He took care to
make no such immodest scrutiny of them as Girard
had done, contenting himself with a look at the wound
upon her foot. Of her trances he saw quite enough.
On a sudden, a burning heat would diffuse itself
everywhere from her heart. Losing her consciousness,
she went into convulsions and talked wildly.</p>

<p>The Carmelite clearly perceived that in her were
two persons, the young woman and the Demon. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
former was honest, nay, very fresh of heart; ignorant,
for all that had been done to her; little able to understand
the very things that had brought her into
such sore trouble. When, before confession, she spoke
of Girard&#8217;s kisses, the Carmelite roughly said, &#8220;But
those are very great sins.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;O God!&#8221; she answered, weeping, &#8220;I am lost
indeed, for he has done much more than that to me!&#8221;</p>

<p>The bishop came to see. For him the country-house
was only the length of a walk. She answered his
questions artlessly, told him at least how things began.
The bishop was angry, mortified, very wroth. No
doubt he guessed the remainder. There was nought
to keep him from raising a great outcry against
Girard. Not caring for the danger of a struggle with
the Jesuits, he entered thoroughly into the Carmelite&#8217;s
views, allowed that she was bewitched, and added that
<i>Girard himself was the wizard</i>. He wanted to lay him
that very moment under a solemn ban, to bring him to
disgrace and ruin. Cadi&egrave;re prayed for him who had
done her so much wrong; vengeance she would not
have. Falling on her knees before the bishop, she
implored him to spare Girard, to speak no more of
things so sorrowful. With touching humility, she
said, &#8220;It is enough for me to be enlightened at last, to
know that I was living in sin.&#8221; Her Jacobin brother
took her part, foreseeing the perils of such a war, and
doubtful whether the bishop would stand fast.</p>

<p>Her attacks of disorder were now fewer. The season<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
had changed. The burning summer was over. Nature
at length showed mercy. It was the pleasant
month of October. The bishop had the keen delight
of feeling that she had been saved by him. No longer
under Girard&#8217;s influence in the stifling air of Ollioules,
but well cared-for by her family, by the brave and
honest monk, protected, too, by the bishop, who never
grudged his visits, and who shielded her with his
steady countenance, the young girl became altogether
calm.</p>

<p>For seven weeks or so she seemed quite well-behaved.
The bishop&#8217;s happiness was so great that
he wanted the Carmelite, with Cadi&egrave;re&#8217;s help, to look
after Girard&#8217;s other penitents, and bring them also
back to their senses. They should go to the country-house;
how unwillingly, and with how ill a grace we
can easily guess. In truth, it was strangely ill-judged
to bring those women before the bishop&#8217;s ward, a girl
so young still, and but just delivered from her own
ecstatic ravings.</p>

<p>The state of things became ridiculous and sorely
embittered. Two parties faced each other, Girard&#8217;s
women and those of the bishop. On the side of the
latter were a German lady and her daughter, dear
friends of Cadi&egrave;re&#8217;s. On the other side were the
rebels, headed by the Guiol. With her the bishop
treated, in hopes of getting her to enter into relations
with the Carmelite, and bring her friends over to him.
He sent her his own clerk, and then a solicitor, an old<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
lover of Guiol&#8217;s. All this failing of any effect, the
bishop came to his last resource, determined to summon
them all to his palace. Here they mostly denied those
trances and mystic marks of which they had made
such boast. One of them, Guiol, of course, astonished
him yet more by her shamelessly treacherous
offer to prove to him, on the spot, that they had no
marks whatever about their bodies. They had deemed
him wanton enough to fall into such a snare. But he
kept clear of it very well, declining the offer with
thanks to those who, at the cost of their own modesty,
would have had him copy Girard, and provoke the
laughter of all the town.</p>

<p>The bishop was not lucky. On the one hand, these
bold wenches made fun of him. On the other, his
success with Cadi&egrave;re was now being undone. She
had hardly entered her own narrow lane in gloomy
Toulon, when she began to fall off. She was just in
those dangerous and baleful centres where her illness
began, on the very field of the battle waged by the two
hostile parties. The Jesuits, whose rearguard everyone
saw in the Court, had on their side the crafty,
the prudent, the knowing. The Carmelite had none
but the bishop with him, was not even backed by his
own brethren, nor yet by the clergy. He had one
weapon, however, in reserve. On the 8th November,
he got out of Cadi&egrave;re a written power to reveal her
confession in case of need.</p>

<p>It was a daring, dauntless step, which made Girard<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
shudder. He was not very brave, and would have
been undone had his cause not been that of the Jesuits
also. He cowered down in the depths of their college.
But his colleague Sabatier, an old, sanguine, passionate
fellow, went straight to the bishop&#8217;s palace. He
entered into the prelate&#8217;s presence, like another Popilius,
bearing peace or war in his gown. He pushed
him to the wall, made him understand that a suit with
the Jesuits would lead to his own undoing; that he
would remain for ever Bishop of Toulon; would never
rise to an archbishopric. Yet further, with the freedom
of an apostle strong at Versailles, he assured
him that if this affair exposed the morals of a Jesuit,
it would shed no less light on the morals of a bishop.
In a letter, clearly planned by Girard, it was pretended
that the Jesuits held themselves ready in the background,
to hurl dreadful recriminations against the
prelate, declaring his way of life not only unepiscopal,
but <i>abominable</i> withal. The sly, faithless Girard and
the hot-headed Sabatier, swollen with rage and spitefulness,
would have pressed the calumnious charge.
They would not have failed to say that all this matter
was about a girl; that if Girard had taken care of her
when ill, the bishop had gotten her when she was well.
What a commotion would be caused by such a scandal
in the well-regulated life of the great worldly lord!
It were too laughable a piece of chivalry to make war
in revenge for the maidenhood of a weak little fool,
to embroil oneself for her sake with all honest people!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
The Cardinal of Bonzi died indeed of grief at Toulouse,
but that was on account of a fair lady, the
Marchioness of Ganges. The bishop, on his part,
risked his ruin, risked the chance of being overwhelmed
with shame and ridicule, for the child of a retail-dealer
in the Rue de l&#8217;H&ocirc;pital!</p>

<p>Sabatier&#8217;s threatenings made all the greater impression,
because the bishop himself clung less firmly to
Cadi&egrave;re. He did not thank her for falling ill again;
for giving the lie to his former success; for doing
him a wrong by her relapse. He bore her a grudge
for having failed to cure her. He said to himself that
Sabatier was in the right; that he had better come to
a compromise. The change was sudden&mdash;a kind of
warning from above. All at once, like Paul on the
way to Damascus, he beheld the light, and became a
convert to the Jesuits.</p>

<p>Sabatier would not let him go. He put paper before
him, and made him write and sign a decree forbidding
the Carmelite, his agent with Cadi&egrave;re, and another
forbidding her brother, the Jacobin.</p>

<h3>THE TRIAL OF CADIERE: 1730-1731.</h3>


<p class="noind"><span class="smcap">We</span> can guess how this alarming blow was taken by
the Cadi&egrave;re family. The sick girl&#8217;s attacks became
frequent and fearful. By a cruel chance they brought
on a kind of epidemic among her intimate friends.
Her neighbour, the German lady, who had trances
also, which she had hitherto deemed divine, now fell
into utter fright, and fancied they came from hell.
This worthy dame of fifty years remembered that she,
too, had often had unclean thoughts: she believed
herself given over to the Devil; saw nothing but
devils about her; and escaping from her own house in
spite of her daughter&#8217;s watchfulness, entreated shelter
from the Cadi&egrave;res. From that time the house became
unbearable; business could not be carried on.
The elder Cadi&egrave;re inveighed furiously against Girard,
crying, &#8220;He shall be served like Gauffridi: he, too,
shall be burnt!&#8221; And the Jacobin added, &#8220;Rather
would we waste the whole of our family estate!&#8221;</p>

<p>On the night of the 17th November, Cadi&egrave;re
screamed, and was like one choking. They thought
she was going to die. The eldest Cadi&egrave;re, the tradesman,
lost his wits, and called out to his neighbours<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
from the window, &#8220;Help! the Devil is throttling my
sister!&#8221; They came running up almost in their shirts.
The doctors and surgeons wanted to apply the cupping-glasses
to a case of what they called &#8220;suffocation
of the womb.&#8221; While some were gone to fetch these,
they succeeded in unlocking her teeth and making her
swallow a drop of brandy, which brought her to herself.
Meanwhile there also came to the girl some
doctors of the soul; first an old priest confessor to
Cadi&egrave;re&#8217;s mother, and then some parsons of Toulon.
All this noise and shouting, the arrival of the priests
in full dress, the preparations for exorcising, had
brought everyone out into the street. The newcomers
kept asking what was the matter. &#8220;Cadi&egrave;re has been
bewitched by Girard,&#8221; was the continual reply. We
may imagine the pity and the wrath of the people.</p>

<p>Greatly alarmed, but anxious to cast the fear back
on others, the Jesuits did a very barbarous thing.
They returned to the bishop, ordered and insisted that
Cadi&egrave;re should be brought to trial; that the attack
should be made that very day; that justice should
make an unforeseen descent on this poor girl, as she
lay rattling in the throat after the last dreadful
seizure.</p>

<p>Sabatier never left the bishop until the latter had
called his judge, his officer, the Vicar-general Larmedieu,
and his prosecutor or episcopal advocate, Esprit
Reybaud, and commanded them to go to work forthwith.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span></p>

<p>By the Canon Law this was impossible, illegal. A
<i>preliminary inquiry was needed</i> into the facts, before
the judicial business could begin. There was another
difficulty: the spiritual judge had no right to make
such an arrest save for <i>a rejection of the Sacrament</i>.
The two church-lawyers must have made these objections.
But Sabatier would hear of no excuses. If
matters were allowed to drag in this cold legal way, he
would miss his stroke of terror.</p>

<p>Larmedieu was a compliant judge, a friend of the
clergy. He was not one of your rude magistrates
who go straight before them, like blind boars, on the
high-road of the law, without seeing or respecting anyone.
He had shown great regard for Aubany, the
patron of Ollioules, during his trial; helping him to
escape by the slowness of his own procedure. Afterwards,
when he knew him to be at Marseilles, as if
that was far from France, in the <i>ultima thule</i> or <i>terra
incognita</i> of ancient geographers, he would not budge
any further. This, however, was a very different case:
the judge who was so paralytic against Aubany, had
wings, and wings of lightning, for Cadi&egrave;re. It was nine
in the morning when the dwellers in the lane saw with
much curiosity a grand procession arrive at the Cadi&egrave;res&#8217;
door, with Master Larmedieu and the episcopal advocate
at the head, honoured by an escort of two clergymen,
doctors of theology. The house was invaded:
the sick girl was summoned before them. They made
her swear to tell the truth against herself; swear to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
defame herself by speaking out in the ears of justice
matters that touched her conscience and the confessional
only.</p>

<p>She might have dispensed with an answer, for none
of the usual forms had been observed: but she would
not raise the question. She took the oath that was
meant to disarm and betray her. For, being once
bound thereby, she told everything, even to those
shameful and ridiculous details which it must be very
painful for any girl to acknowledge.</p>

<p>Larmedieu&#8217;s official statement and his first examination
point to a clearly settled agreement between
him and the Jesuits. Girard was to be brought forward
as the dupe and prey of Cadi&egrave;re&#8217;s knavery.
Fancy a man of sixty, a doctor, professor, director of
nuns, being therewithal so innocent and credulous,
that a young girl, a mere child, was enough to draw
him into the snare! The cunning, shameless wanton
had beguiled him with her visions, but failed to draw
him into her own excesses. Enraged thereat, she
endowed him with every baseness that the fancy of a
Messalina could suggest to her!</p>

<p>So far from giving grounds for any such idea, the
examination brings out the victim&#8217;s gentleness in a
very touching way. Evidently she accuses others only
through constraint, under the pressure of her oath
just taken. She is gentle towards her enemies, even
to the faithless Guiol who, in her brother&#8217;s words, had
betrayed her; had done her worst to corrupt her; had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
ruined her, last of all, by making her give up the
papers which would have insured her safety.</p>

<p>The Cadi&egrave;re brothers were frightened at their sister&#8217;s
artlessness. In her regard for her oath she gave herself
up without reserve to be vilified, alas! for ever;
to have ballads sung about her; to be mocked by
the very foes of Jesuits and silly scoffing libertines.</p>

<p>The mischief done, they wanted at least to have it
defined, to have the official report of the priests
checked by some more serious measure. Seeming
though she did to be the party accused, they made her
the accuser, and prevailed on Marteli Chantard, the
King&#8217;s Lieutenant Civil and Criminal, to come and
take her deposition. In this document, short and
clear, the fact of her seduction is clearly established;
likewise the reproaches she uttered against Girard for
his lewd endearments, reproaches at which he only
laughed; likewise the advice he gave her, to let herself
be possessed by the Demon; likewise the means
he used for keeping her wounds open, and so on.</p>

<p>The King&#8217;s officer, the Lieutenant, was bound to
carry the matter before his own court. For the spiritual
judge in his hurry had failed to go through the
forms of ecclesiastic law, and so made his proceedings
null. But the lay magistrate lacked the courage for
this. He let himself be harnessed to the clerical
inquiry, accepted Larmedieu for his colleague, went
himself to sit and hear the evidence in the bishop&#8217;s
court. The clerk of the bishopric wrote it down, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
not the clerk of the King&#8217;s Lieutenant. Did he
write it down faithfully? We have reason to doubt that,
when we find him threatening the witnesses, and going
every night to show their statements to the Jesuits.</p>

<p>The two curates of Cadi&egrave;re&#8217;s parish, who were heard
first, deposed drily, not in her favour, yet by no
means against her, certainly not in favour of the
Jesuits. These latter saw that everything was going
amiss for them. Lost to all shame, at the risk of
angering the people, they determined to break all
down. They got from the bishop an order to imprison
Cadi&egrave;re and the chief witnesses she wanted to be heard.
These were the German lady and Batarelle. The girl
herself was placed in the Refuge, a convent-prison;
the ladies in a bridewell, the <i>Good-Shepherd</i>, where
mad women and foul streetwalkers needing punishment
were thrown. On the 26th November, Cadi&egrave;re
was dragged from her bed and given over to the Ursulines,
penitents of Girard&#8217;s, who laid her duly on some
rotten straw.</p>

<p>A fear of them thus established, the witnesses might
now be heard. They began with two, choice and
respectable. One was the Guiol, notorious for being
Girard&#8217;s pander, a woman of keen and clever tongue,
who was commissioned to hurl the first dart and open
the wound of slander. The other was Laugier, the
little seamstress, whom Cadi&egrave;re had supported and for
whose apprenticeship she had paid. While she lay
with child by Girard, this Laugier had cried out against<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
him; now she washed away her fault by sneering at
Cadi&egrave;re and defiling her benefactress, but in a very
clumsy way, like the shameless wanton she was;
ascribing to her impudent speeches quite contrary to
her known habits. Then came Mdlle. Gravier and her
cousin Reboul&mdash;all the <i>Girardites</i>, in short, as they
were called in Toulon.</p>

<p>But, do as they would, the light would burst forth
now and then. The wife of a purveyor in the house
where these Girardites met together, said, with cruel
plainness, that she could not abide them, that they
disturbed the whole house; she spoke of their noisy
bursts of laughter, of their suppers paid for out of the
money collected for the poor, and so forth.</p>

<p>They were sore afraid lest the nuns should speak out
for Cadi&egrave;re. The bishop&#8217;s clerk told them, as if
from the bishop himself, that those who spoke evil
should be chastised. As a yet stronger measure, they
ordered back from Marseilles the gay Father Aubany,
who had some ascendant over the nuns. His affair
with the girl he had violated was got settled for him.
Her parents were made to understand that justice could
do nothing in their case. The child&#8217;s good name was
valued at eight hundred livres, which were paid on Aubany&#8217;s
account. So, full of zeal, he returned, a thorough
Jesuit, to his troop at Ollioules. The poor troop
trembled indeed, when this worthy father told them
of his commission to warn them that, if they did not
behave themselves, &#8220;they should be put to the torture.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>For all that, they could not get as much as they
wanted from these fifteen nuns. Two or three at
most were on Girard&#8217;s side, but all stated facts, especially
about the 7th July, which bore directly against
him.</p>

<p>In despair the Jesuits came to an heroic decision, in
order to make sure of their witnesses. They stationed
themselves in an outer hall which led into the court.
There they stopped those going in, tampered with
them, threatened them, and, if they were against
Girard, coolly debarred their entrance by thrusting
them out of doors.</p>

<p>Thus the clerical judge and the King&#8217;s officer were
only as puppets in the Jesuits&#8217; hands. The whole town
saw this and trembled. During December, January,
and February, the Cadi&egrave;re family drew up and diffused
a complaint touching the way in which justice was
denied them and witnesses suborned. The Jesuits
themselves felt that the place would no longer hold
them. They evoked help from a higher quarter. This
seemed best available in the shape of a decree of the
Great Council, which would have brought the matter
before itself and hushed up everything, as Mazarin
had done in the Louviers affair. But the Chancellor
was D&#8217;Aguesseau; and the Jesuits had no wish to
let the matter go up to Paris. They kept it still in
Provence. On the 16th January, 1731, they got
the King to determine that the Parliament of Provence,
where they had plenty of friends, should pass sentence<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
on the inquiry which two of its councillors were conducting
at Toulon.</p>

<p>M. Faucon, a layman, and M. de Charleval, a councillor
of the Church, came in fact and straightway
marched down among the Jesuits. These eager commissioners
made so little secret of their loud and
bitter partiality, as to toss out an order for Cadi&egrave;re&#8217;s
remand, just as they might have done to an accused
prisoner; whilst Girard was most politely called up
and allowed to go free, to keep on saying mass and
hearing confessions. And so the plaintiff was kept
under lock and key, in her enemies&#8217; hands, exposed to
all manner of cruelty from Girard&#8217;s devotees.</p>

<p>From these honest Ursulines she met with just such
a reception as if they had been charged to bring about
her death. The room they gave her was the cell of a
mad nun who made everything filthy. In the nun&#8217;s
old straw, in the midst of a frightful stench, she lay.
Her kinsmen on the morrow had much ado to get in a
coverlet and mattress for her use. For her nurse and
keeper she was allowed a poor tool of Girard&#8217;s, a lay-sister,
daughter to that very Guiol who had betrayed
her; a girl right worthy of her mother, capable of any
wickedness, a source of danger to her modesty, perhaps
even to her life. They submitted her to a course
of penance in her case specially painful, refusing her
the right of confessing herself or taking the sacrament.
She relapsed into her illness from the time she
was debarred the latter privilege. Her fierce foe, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
Jesuit Sabatier, came into her cell, and formed a new
and startling scheme to win her by a bribe of the
holy wafer. The bargaining began. They offered
her terms: she should communicate if she would only
acknowledge herself a slanderer, unworthy of communicating.
In her excessive humbleness she might have
done so. But, while ruining herself, she would also
have ruined the Carmelite and her own brethren.</p>

<p>Reduced to Pharisaical tricks, they took to expounding
her speeches. Whatever she uttered in a mystic
sense they feigned to accept in its material hardness.
To free herself from such snares she displayed, what
they had least expected, very great presence of mind.</p>

<p>A yet more treacherous plan for robbing her of the
public sympathy and setting the laughers against her,
was to find her a lover. They pretended that she had
proposed to a young blackguard that they should set
off together and roam the world.</p>

<p>The great lords of that day, being fond of having
children and little pages to wait on them, readily took
in the better-mannered of their peasant&#8217;s sons. In
this way had the bishop dealt with the boy of one of
his tenants. He washed his face, as it were; made
him tidy. Presently, when the favourite grew up, he
gave him the tonsure, dressed him up like an abb&eacute;, and
dubbed him his chaplain at the age of twenty. This
person was the Abb&eacute; Camerle. Brought up with the
footmen and made to do everything, he was, like many
a half-scrubbed country youth, a sly, but simple lout.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
He saw that the prelate since his arrival at Toulon
had been curious about Cadi&egrave;re and far from friendly
to Girard. He thought to please and amuse his master
by turning himself, at Ollioules, into a spy on their
suspected intercourse. But after the bishop changed
through fear of the Jesuits, Camerle became equally
zealous in helping Girard with active service against
Cadi&egrave;re.</p>

<p>He came one day, like another Joseph, to say that
Mdlle. Cadi&egrave;re had, like Potiphar&#8217;s wife, been tempting
him, and trying to shake his virtue. Had this been
true, it was all the more cowardly of him thus to
punish her for a moment&#8217;s weakness, to take so mean
an advantage of some light word. But his education
as page and seminarist was not such as to bring him
either honour or the love of women.</p>

<p>She extricated herself with spirit and success,
covering him with shame. The two angry commissioners
saw her making so triumphant an answer, that
they cut the investigation short, and cut down the
number of her witnesses. Out of the sixty-eight she
summoned, they allowed but thirty-eight to appear.
Regardless alike of the delays and the forms of justice,
they hurried forward the confronting of witnesses.
Yet nothing was gained, thereby. On the 25th and
again on the 26th February, she renewed her crushing
declarations.</p>

<p>Such was their rage thereat, that they declared their
regret at the want of torments and executioners in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
Toulon, &#8220;who might have made her sing out a little.&#8221;
These things formed their <i>ultima ratio</i>. They were
employed, by the Parliaments through all that century.
I have before me a warm defence of torture,<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> written
in 1780, by a learned member of Parliament, who also
became a member of the Great Council; it was dedicated
to the King, Louis XVI., and crowned with the
flattering approval of His Holiness Pius VI.</p>

<p>But, in default of the torture that would have made
her sing, she was made to speak by a still better
process. On the 27th February, Guiol&#8217;s daughter, the
lay-sister who acted as her jailer, came to her at an
early hour with a glass of wine. She was astonished:
she was not at all thirsty: she never drank wine,
especially pure wine, of a morning. The lay-sister, a
rough, strong menial, such as they keep in convents to
manage crazy or refractory women, and to punish
children, overwhelmed the feeble sufferer with remonstrances
that looked like threats. Unwilling as she
was, she drank. And she was forced to drink it all,
to the very dregs, which she found unpleasantly salt.</p>

<p>What was this repulsive draught? We have already
seen how clever these old confessors of nuns were at
remedies of various kinds. In this case the wine
alone would have done for so weakly a patient. It
had been quite enough to make her drunk, to draw
from her at once some stammering speeches, which
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>the clerk might have moulded into a downright falsehood.
But a drug of some kind, perhaps some
wizard&#8217;s simple, which would act for several days, was
added to the wine, in order to prolong its effects and
leave her no way of disproving anything laid to her
charge.</p>

<p>In her declaration of the 27th February, how
sudden and entire a change! It is nothing but a
defence of Girard! Strange to say, the commissioners
make no remark on so abrupt a change. The
strange, shameful sight of a young girl drunk causes
no astonishment, fails to put them on their guard.
She is made to own that all which had passed between
herself and Girard was merely the offspring of her own
diseased fancy; that all she had spoken of as real, at
the bidding of her brethren and the Carmelite, was
nothing more than a dream. Not content with
whitening Girard, she must blacken her own friends,
must crush them, and put the halter round their necks.</p>

<p>Especially wonderful is the clearness of her deposition,
the neat way in which it is worded. The
hand of the skilful clerk peeps out therefrom. It is
very strange, however, that now they are in so fair a
way, they do not follow it up. From the 27th to the
6th of March there is no further questioning.</p>

<p>On the 28th, the poison having doubtless done its
work, and plunged her into a perfect stupor, or else a
kind of Sabbatic frenzy, it was impossible to bring
her forth. After that, while her head was still disordered,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
they could easily give her other potions of
which she would know and remember nothing. What
happened during those six days seems to have been so
shocking, so sad for poor Cadi&egrave;re, that neither she
nor her brother had the heart to speak of it twice.
Nor would they have spoken at all, had not the
brethren themselves incurred a prosecution aiming at
their own lives.</p>

<p>Having won his cause through Cadi&egrave;re&#8217;s falsehood,
Girard dared to come and see her in her prison, where
she lay stupefied or in despair, forsaken alike of earth
and heaven, and if any clear thoughts were left her,
possessed with the dreadful consciousness of having
by her last deposition murdered her own near kin.
Her own ruin was complete already. But another
trial, that of her brothers and the bold Carmelite,
would now begin. She may in her remorse have been
tempted to soften Girard, to keep him from proceeding
against them, above all to save herself from being put
to the torture. Girard, at any rate, took advantage of
her utter weakness, and behaved like the determined
scoundrel he really was.</p>

<p>Alas! her wandering spirit came but slowly back to
her. It was on the 6th March that she had to face
her accusers, to renew her former admissions, to ruin
her brethren beyond repair. She could not speak;
she was choking. The commissioners had the kindness
to tell her that the torture was there, at her side;
to describe to her the wooden horse, the points of iron,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
the wedges for jamming fast her bones. Her courage
failed her, so weak she was now of body. She submitted
to be set before her cruel master, who might
laugh triumphant now that he had debased not only
her body, but yet more her conscience, by making her
the murderess of her own friends.</p>

<p>No time was lost in profiting by her weakness.
They prevailed forthwith on the Parliament of Aix to
let the Carmelite and the two brothers be imprisoned,
that they might undergo a separate trial for their lives,
as soon as Cadi&egrave;re should have been condemned.</p>

<p>On the 10th March, she was dragged from the
Ursulines of Toulon to Sainte-Claire of Ollioules.
Girard, however, was not sure of her yet. He got
leave to have her conducted, like some dreaded highway
robber, between some soldiers of the mounted
police. He demanded that she should be carefully
locked up at Sainte-Claire. The ladies were moved to
tears at the sight of a poor sufferer who could not
drag herself forward, approaching between those drawn
swords. Everyone pitied her. Two brave men, M.
Aubin, a solicitor, and M. Claret, a notary, drew up
for her the deeds in which she withdrew her late confession,
fearful documents that record the threats of
the commissioners and of the Ursuline prioress, and
above all, the fact of the drugged wine she had been
forced to drink.</p>

<p>At the same time these daring men drew up for the
Chancellor&#8217;s court at Paris a plea of error, as it is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
called, exposing the irregular and blameable proceedings,
the wilful breaches of the law, effected in the coolest
way, first by the bishop&#8217;s officer and the King&#8217;s Lieutenant,
secondly by the two commissioners. The
Chancellor D&#8217;Aguesseau showed himself very slack
and feeble. He let these foul proceedings stand; left
the business in charge of the Parliament of Aix,
sullied as it already seemed to be by the disgrace with
which two of its members had just been covering
themselves.</p>

<p>So once more they laid hands on their victim, and
had her dragged, in charge as before of the mounted
police, from Ollioules to Aix. In those days people
slept at a public house midway. Here the corporal
explained that, by virtue of his orders, he would sleep
in the young girl&#8217;s room. They pretended to believe
that an invalid unable to walk, might flee away by
jumping out of window. Truly, it was a most villanous
device, to commit such a one to the chaste keeping
of the heroes of the <i>dragonnades</i>.<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> Happily, her
mother had come to see her start, had followed her in
spite of everything, and they did not dare to beat her
away with their butt-ends. She stayed in the room,
kept watch&mdash;neither of them, indeed, lying down&mdash;and
shielded her child from all harm.</p>

<p>Cadi&egrave;re was forwarded to the Ursulines of Aix, who
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>had the King&#8217;s command to take her in charge. But
the prioress pretended that the order had not yet come.
We may see here how savage a woman who was once
impassioned will grow, until she has lost all her
woman&#8217;s nature. She kept the other four hours at
her street-door, as if she were a public show. There
was time to fetch a mob of Jesuits&#8217; followers, of honest
Church artizans, to hoot and hiss, while children might
help by throwing stones. For these four hours she
was in the pillory. Some, however, of the more dispassionate
passers-by asked if the Ursulines had
gotten orders to let them kill the girl. We may guess
what tender jailers their sick prisoner would find in
these good sisters!</p>

<p>The ground was prepared with admirable effect. By a
spirited concert between Jesuit magistrates and plotting
ladies, a system of deterring had been set on foot.
No pleader would ruin himself by defending a girl
thus heavily aspersed. No one would digest the poisonous
things stored up by her jailers, for him who should
daily show his face in their parlour to await an interview
with Cadi&egrave;re. The defence in that case would
devolve on M. Chaudon, syndic of the Aix bar. He
did not decline so hard a duty. And yet he was so
uneasy as to desire a settlement, which the Jesuits
refused. Thereupon he showed what he really was, a
man of unswerving honesty, of amazing courage. He
exposed, with the learning of a lawyer, the monstrous
character of the whole proceeding. So doing, he would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
for ever embroil himself with the Parliament no less
than the Jesuits. He brought into sharp outline the
spiritual incest of the confessor, though he modestly
refrained from specifying how far he had carried his
profligacy. He also withheld himself from speaking
of Girard&#8217;s girls, the loose-lived devotees, as a matter
well-known, but to which no one would have liked to
bear witness. In short, he gave Girard the best case
he could by assailing him <i>as a wizard</i>. People laughed,
made fun of the advocate. He undertook to prove the
existence of demons by a series of sacred texts, beginning
with the Gospels. This made them laugh the
louder.</p>

<p>The case had been cleverly disfigured by the turning
of an honest Carmelite into Cadi&egrave;re&#8217;s lover, and the
weaver of a whole chain of libels against Girard and
the Jesuits. Thenceforth the crowd of idlers, of
giddy worldlings, scoffers and philosophers alike, made
merry with either side, being thoroughly impartial as
between Carmelite and Jesuit, and exceedingly rejoiced
to see this battle of monk with monk. Those who
were presently to be called <i>Voltairites</i>, were even better
inclined towards the polished Jesuits, those men of the
world, than towards any of the old mendicant orders.</p>

<p>So the matter became more and more tangled.
Jokes kept raining down, but raining mostly on the
victim. They called it a love-intrigue. They saw in
it nothing but food for fun. There was not a scholar
nor a clerk who did not turn a ditty on Girard and his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
pupil, who did not hash up anew the old provincial
jokes about Madeline in the Gauffridi affair, her six
thousand imps, their dread of a flogging, and the
wonderful chastening-process whereby Cadi&egrave;re&#8217;s devils
were put to flight.</p>

<p>On this latter point the friends of Girard had no
difficulty in proving him clean. He had acted by his
right as director, in accordance with the common
wont. The rod is the symbol of fatherhood. He had
treated his penitent with a view to the healing of her
soul. They used to thrash demoniacs, to thrash the
insane and sufferers in other ways. This was the
favourite mode of hunting out the enemy, whether in
the shape of devil or disease. With the people it
was a very common idea. One brave workman of
Toulon, who had witnessed Cadi&egrave;re&#8217;s sad plight,
declared that a bull&#8217;s sinew was the poor sufferer&#8217;s
only cure.</p>

<p>Thus strongly supported, Girard had only to act
reasonably. He would not take the trouble. His defence
is charmingly flippant. He never deigns even
to agree with his own depositions. He gives the lie
to his own witnesses. He seems to be jesting, and
says, with the coolness of a great lord of the Regency,
that if, as they charge him, he was ever shut up with
her, &#8220;it could only have happened nine times.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And why did the good father do so,&#8221; would his
friends say, &#8220;save to watch, to consider, to search
out the truth concerning her? &#8217;Tis the confessor&#8217;s<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
duty in all such cases. Read the life of the most
holy Catherine of Genoa. One evening her confessor
hid himself in her room, waiting to see the wonders
she would work, and to catch her in the act miraculous.
But here, unhappily, the Devil, who never
sleeps, had laid a snare for this lamb of God, had
belched forth this devouring monster of a she-dragon,
this mixture of maniac and demoniac, to swallow him
up, to overwhelm him in a cataract of slander.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was an old and excellent custom to smother
monsters in the cradle. Then why not later also?
Girard&#8217;s ladies charitably advised the instant using
against her of fire and sword. &#8220;Let her perish!&#8221;
cried the devotees. Many of the great ladies also
wished to have her punished, deeming it rather too bad
that such a creature should have dared to enter such a
plea, to bring into court the man who had done her
but too great an honour.</p>

<p>Some determined Jansenists there were in the
Parliament, but these were more inimical to the
Jesuits than friendly to the girl. And they might
well be downcast and discouraged, seeing they had
against them at once the terrible Society of Jesus, the
Court of Versailles, the Cardinal Minister (Fleury),
and, lastly, the drawing-rooms of Aix. Should they
be bolder than the head of the law, the Chancellor
D&#8217;Aguesseau, who had proved so very slack? The
Attorney-General did not waver at all: being charged
with the indictment of Girard, he avowed himself his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
friend, advised him how to meet the charges against
him.</p>

<p>There was, indeed, but one question at issue, to
ascertain by what kind of reparation, of solemn
atonement, of exemplary chastening, the plaintiff thus
changed into the accused might satisfy Girard and
the Company of Jesus. The Jesuits, with all their
good-nature, affirmed the need of an example, in the
interests of religion, by way of some slight warning
both to the Jansenist Convulsionaries and the scribbling
philosophers who were beginning to swarm.</p>

<p>There were two points by which Cadi&egrave;re might be
hooked, might receive the stroke of the harpoon.</p>

<p>Firstly, she had borne false witness. But, then, by
no law could slander be punished with death. To
gain that end you must go a little further, and say,
&#8220;The old Roman text, <i>De famosis libellis</i>, pronounces
death on those who have uttered libels hurtful to the
Emperor or to <i>the religion</i> of the Empire. The
Jesuits represent that religion. Therefore, a memorial
against a Jesuit deserves the last penalty.&#8221;</p>

<p>A still better handle, however, was their second. At
the opening of the trial the episcopal judge, the prudent
Larmedieu, had asked her if she had never <i>divined</i>
the secrets of many people, and she had answered yes.
Therefore they might charge her with the practice
named in the list of forms employed in trials for
witchcraft, as <i>Divination and imposture</i>. This alone
in ecclesiastic law deserved the stake. They might,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
indeed, without much effort, call her a <i>Witch</i>, after the
confession made by the Ollioules ladies, that at one
same hour of the night she used to be in several cells
together. Their infatuation, the surprising tenderness
that suddenly came over them, had all the air of an
enchantment.</p>

<p>What was there to prevent her being burnt? They
were still burning everywhere in the eighteenth century.
In one reign only, that of Philip V., sixteen
hundred people were burnt in Spain: one Witch was
burnt as late as 1782. In Germany one was burnt in
1751; in Switzerland one also in 1781. Rome was
always burning her victims, on the sly indeed, in the
dark holes and cells of the Inquisition.<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a></p>

<p>&#8220;But France, at least, is surely more humane?&#8221;
She is very inconsistent. In 1718, a Wizard is burnt
at Bordeaux.<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> In 1724 and 1726, the faggots were
lighted in Gr&egrave;ve for offences which passed as schoolboy
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>jokes at Versailles. The guardians of the Royal
child, the Duke and Fleury, who are so indulgent to
the Court, are terrible to the town. A donkey-driver
and a noble, one M. des Chauffours, are burnt alive.
The advent of the Cardinal Minister could not be
celebrated more worthily than by a moral reformation,
by making a severe example of those who corrupted
the people. Nothing more timely than to pass some
terrible and solemn sentence on this infernal girl,
who made so heinous an assault on the innocent
Girard!</p>

<p>Observe what was needed to wash that father clean.
It was needful to show that, even if he had done
wrong and imitated Des Chauffours, he had been the
sport of some enchantment. The documents were
but too plain. By the wording of the Canon Law,
and after these late decrees, somebody ought to be
burnt. Of the five magistrates on the bench, two
only would have burnt Girard. Three were against
Cadi&egrave;re. They came to terms. The three who
formed the majority would not insist on burning her,
would forego the long, dreadful scene at the stake,
would content themselves with a simple award of
death.</p>

<p>In the name of these five, it was settled, pending
the final assent of Parliament, &#8220;That Cadi&egrave;re,
having first been put to the torture in both kinds,
should afterwards be removed to Toulon, and suffer
death by hanging on the Place des Pr&ecirc;cheurs.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>This was a dreadful blow. An immense revulsion
of feeling at once took place. The worldlings, the
jesters ceased to laugh: they shuddered. Their love
of trifling did not lead them to slur over a result so
horrible. That a girl should be seduced, ill-used,
dishonoured, treated as a mere toy, that she should
die of grief, or of frenzy, they had regarded as right
and good; with all that they had no concern. But
when it was a case of punishment, when in fancy they
saw before them the woeful victim, with rope round her
neck, by the gallows where she was about to hang, their
hearts rose in revolt. From all sides went forth the
cry, &#8220;Never, since the world began, was there seen so
villanous a reversal of things; the law of rape administered
the wrong way, the girl condemned for having
been made a tool, the victim hanged by her seducer!&#8221;</p>

<p>In this town of Aix, made up of judges, priests,
and the world of fashion, a thing unforeseen occurred:
a whole people suddenly rose, a violent popular movement
was astir. A crowd of persons of every class
marched in one close well-ordered body straight
towards the Ursulines. Cadi&egrave;re and her mother were
bidden to show themselves. &#8220;Make yourself easy,
mademoiselle,&#8221; they shouted: &#8220;we stand by you:
fear nothing!&#8221;</p>

<p>The grand eighteenth century, justly called by
Hegel the &#8220;reign of mind,&#8221; was still grander as the
&#8220;reign of humanity.&#8221; Ladies of distinction, such as
the granddaughter of Mde. de S&eacute;vign&eacute;, the charming<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
Madame de Simiane, took possession of the young
girl and sheltered her in their bosoms.</p>

<p>A thing yet prettier and more touching was it, to
see the Jansenist ladies, elsewhile so sternly pure, so
hard towards each other, in their austerities so severe,
now in this great conjuncture offer up Law on the
altar of Mercy, by flinging their arms round the poor
threatened child, purifying her with kisses on the
forehead, baptizing her anew in tears.</p>

<p>If Provence be naturally wild, she is all the more
wonderful in these wild moments of generosity and
real greatness. Something of this was later seen in
the earliest triumphs of Mirabeau, when he had a
million of men gathered round him at Marseilles.
But here already was a great revolutionary scene, a
vast uprising against the stupid Government of the
day, and Fleury&#8217;s pets the Jesuits: a unanimous uprising
in behalf of humanity, of compassion, in
defence of a woman, a very child, thus barbarously
offered up. The Jesuits fancied that among their
own rabble, among their clients and their beggars,
they might array a kind of popular force, armed with
handbells and staves to beat back the party of
Cadi&egrave;re. This latter, however, included almost everyone.
Marseilles rose up as one man to bear in
triumph the son of the Advocate Chaudon. Toulon
went so far for the sake of her poor townswoman, as
to think of burning the Jesuit college.</p>

<p>The most touching of all these tokens in Cadi&egrave;re&#8217;s<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
favour, reached her from Ollioules. A simple boarder,
Mdlle. Agnes, for all her youthful shyness, followed the
impulse of her own heart, threw herself into the press
of pamphlets, and published a defence of Cadi&egrave;re.</p>

<p>So widespread and deep a movement had its effect
on the Parliament itself. The foes of the Jesuits
raised their heads, took courage to defy the threats of
those above, the influence of the Jesuits, and the bolts
that Fleury might hurl upon them from Versailles.<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a></p>

<p>The very friends of Girard, seeing their numbers
fall off, their phalanx grow thin, were eager for the
sentence. It was pronounced on the 11th October,
1731.</p>

<p>In sight of the popular feeling, no one dared to
follow up the savage sentence of the bench, by getting
Cadi&egrave;re hanged. Twelve councillors sacrificed their
honour, by declaring Girard innocent. Of the twelve
others, some Jansenists condemned him to the flames
as a wizard; and three or four, with better reason, condemned
him to death as a scoundrel. Twelve being
against twelve, the President Lebret had to give the
casting vote. He found for Girard. Acquitted of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>the capital crime of witchcraft, the latter was then
made over, as priest and confessor, to the Toulon
magistrate, his intimate friend Larmedieu, for trial in
the bishop&#8217;s court.</p>

<p>The great folk and the indifferent ones were satisfied.
And so little heed was given to this award, that
even in these days it has been said that &#8220;both were
<i>acquitted</i>.&#8221; The statement is not correct. Cadi&egrave;re
was treated as a slanderer, was condemned to see her
memorials and other papers burnt by the hand of the
executioner.</p>

<p>There was still a dreadful something in the background.
Cadi&egrave;re being so marked, so branded for the
use of calumny, the Jesuits were sure to keep pushing
underhand their success with Cardinal Fleury, and to
urge her being punished in some secret, arbitrary
way. Such was the notion imbibed by the town of
Aix. It felt that, instead of sending her home, Parliament
would rather <i>yield her up</i>. This caused so
fearful a rage, such angry menaces, against President
Lebret, that he asked to have the regiment of
Flanders sent thither.</p>

<p>Girard was fleeing away in a close carriage, when
they found him out and would have killed him, had he
not escaped into the Jesuits&#8217; Church. There the rascal
betook himself to saying mass. After his escape
thence he returned to D&ocirc;le, to reap honour and glory
from the Society. Here, in 1733, he died, <i>in the perfume
of holiness</i>. The courtier Lebret died in 1735.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span></p>

<p>Cardinal Fleury did whatever the Jesuits pleased.
At Aix, Toulon, Marseilles, many were banished, or cast
into prison. Toulon was specially guilty, as having
borne Girard&#8217;s effigy to the doors of his <i>Girardites</i>, and
carried about the thrice holy standard of the Jesuits.</p>

<p>According to the terms of the award, Cadi&egrave;re should
have been free to return home, to live again with her
mother. But I venture to say that she was never
allowed to re-enter her native town, that flaming
theatre wherein so many voices had been raised in
her behalf.</p>

<p>If only to feel an interest in her was a crime deserving
imprisonment, we cannot doubt but that she
herself was presently thrown into prison; that the
Jesuits easily obtained a special warrant from Versailles
to lock up the poor girl, to hush up, to bury
with her an affair so dismal for themselves. They
would wait, of course, until the public attention was
drawn off to something else. Thereon the fatal clutch
would have caught her anew; she would have been
buried out of sight in some unknown convent, snuffed
out in some dark <i>In pace</i>.</p>

<p>She was but one-and-twenty at the time of the
award, and she had always hoped to die soon. May
God have granted her that mercy!<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a></p>

his comments on the trial, on the share the Devil might have
had therein, when a loud noise was heard. A black man fell
down the chimney. In their fright they all ran away, save
the Recorder only, who, being entangled in his robe, could not
move. The man made some excuse. It was simply a chimneysweep
who had mistaken his chimney.</p></div>

<h2><a name="EPILOGUE" id="EPILOGUE"></a>EPILOGUE.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span></h2>


<p class="noind"><span class="smcap">A woman</span> of genius, in a burst of noble tenderness,
has figured to herself the two spirits whose strife
moulded the Middle Ages, as coming at last to recognise
each other, to draw together, to renew their
olden friendship. Looking closer at each other, they
discern, though somewhat late, the marks of a common
parentage. How if they were indeed brethren, and
this long battle nought but a mistake? Their hearts
speak, and they are softened. The haughty outlaw
and the gentle persecutor have forgotten everything:
they dart forward and throw themselves into each
other&#8217;s arms.&mdash;(<i>Consuelo.</i>)</p>

<p>A charming, womanly idea. Others, too, have
dreamed the same dream. The sweet Montanelli
turned it into a beautiful poem. Ay, who would not
welcome the delightful hope of seeing the battle here
hushed down and finished by an embrace so moving?</p>

<p>What does the wise Merlin think of it? In the
mirror of his lake, whose depths are known to himself
only, what did he behold? What said he in the colossal
epic produced by him in 1860? Why, that Satan
will not disarm, if disarm he ever do, until the Day of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
Judgment. Then, side by side, at peace with each
other, the two will fall asleep in a common death.</p>

<hr />

<p>It is not so hard, indeed, to bend them into a kind
of compromise. The weakening, relaxing effects of so
long a battle allow of their mingling in a certain way.
In the last chapter we saw two shadows agreeing to
form an alliance in deceit; the Devil appearing as the
friend of Loyola, devotees and demoniacs marching
abreast, Hell touched to softness in the Sacred Heart.</p>

<p>It is a quiet time now, and people hate each other
less than formerly. They hate few indeed but their
own friends. I have seen Methodists admiring
Jesuits. Those lawyers and physicians whom the
Church in the Middle Ages called the children of
Satan, I have seen making shrewd covenant with the
old conquered Spirit.</p>

<p>But get we away from these pretences. They who
gravely propose that Satan should make peace and
settle down, have they thought much about the matter?</p>

<p>There is no hindrance as regards ill-will. The dead
are dead. The millions of former victims sleep in
peace, be they Albigenses, Vaudois, or Protestants,
Moors, Jews, or American Indians. The Witch,
universal martyr of the Middle Ages, has nought to
say. Her ashes have been scattered to the winds.</p>

<p>Know you, then, what it is that raises a protest, that
keeps these two spirits steadily apart, preventing them<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>
from coming nearer? It is a huge reality, born five
hundred years ago; a gigantic creation accursed by
the Church, even that mighty fabric of science and
modern institutions, which she excommunicated stone
by stone, but which with every anathema has grown a
storey higher. You cannot name one science which
has not been itself a rebellion.</p>

<p>There is but one way of reconciling the two spirits,
of joining into one the two churches. Demolish the
younger, that one which from its first beginning was
pronounced guilty and doomed as such. Let us, if
we can, destroy the natural sciences, the observatory,
the museum, the botanical garden, the schools of
medicine, and all the modern libraries. Let us burn
our laws, our bodies of statutes, and return to the
Canon Law.</p>

<p>All these novelties came of Satan. Each step forward
has been a crime of his doing.</p>

<p>He was the wicked logician who, despising the
clerical law, preserved and renewed that of jurists and
philosophers, grounded on an impious faith, on the
freedom of the will.</p>

<p>He was that dangerous magician who, while men
were discussing the sex of angels and other questions
of like sublimity, threw himself fiercely on realities,
and created chemistry, physics, mathematics&mdash;ay,
even mathematics. He sought to revive them, and
that was rebellion. People were burnt for saying that
three made three.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span></p>

<p>Medicine especially was a Satanic thing, a rebellion
against disease, the scourge so justly dealt by God.
It was clearly sinful to check the soul on its way
towards heaven, to plunge it afresh into life!</p>

<p>What atonement shall we make for all this? How
are we to put down, to overthrow, this pile of insurrections,
whereof at this moment all modern life is
made up? Will Satan destroy his work, that he
may tread once more the way of angels? That work
rests on three everlasting rocks, Reason, Right, and
Nature.</p>

<hr />

<p>So great is the triumph of the new spirit, that he
forgets his battles, hardly at this moment deigns to
remember that he has won.</p>

<p>It were not amiss to remind him of his wretched
beginnings, how coarsely mean, how rude and painfully
comic were the shapes he wore in the season of
persecution, when through a woman, even the unhappy
Witch, he made his first homely flights in science.
Bolder than the heretic, the half-Christian reasoner,
the scholar who kept one foot within the sacred circle,
this woman eagerly escaped therefrom, and under the
open sunlight tried to make herself an altar of rough
moorland stones.</p>

<p>She has perished, as she was certain to perish. By
what means? Chiefly by the progress of those very
sciences which began with her, through the physician,
the naturalist, for whom she had once toiled.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span></p>

<p>The Witch has perished for ever, but not the Fay.
She will reappear in the form that never dies.</p>

<p>Busied in these latter days with the affairs of men,
Woman has in return given up her rightful part, that
of the physician, the comforter, the healing Fairy.
Herein lies her proper priesthood&mdash;a priesthood that
does belong to her, whatever the Church may say.</p>

<p>Her delicate organs, her fondness for the least detail,
her tender consciousness of life, all invite her to
become Life&#8217;s shrewd interpreter in every science of
observation. With her tenderly pitiful heart, her
power of divining goodness, she goes of her own
accord to the work of doctoring. There is but small
difference between children and sick people. For both
of them we need the Woman.</p>

<p>She will return into the paths of science, whither,
as a smile of nature, gentleness and humanity will
enter by her side.</p>

<p>The Anti-natural is growing dim, nor is the day far
off when its eclipse will bring back daylight to the
earth.</p>

<hr />

<p>The gods may vanish, but God is still there. Nay,
but the less we see of them, the more manifest is He.
He is like a lighthouse eclipsed at moments, but
alway shining again more clearly than before.</p>

<p>It is a remarkable thing to see Him discussed so
fully, even in the journals themselves. People begin
to feel that all questions of education, government,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>
childhood, and womanhood, turn on that one ruling
and underlying question. As God is, so must the
world be.</p>

<p>From this we gather that the times are ripe.</p>

<hr />

<p>So near, indeed, is that religious dayspring that I
seemed momently to see it breaking over the desert
where I brought this book to an end.</p>

<p>How full of light, how rough and beautiful looked
this desert of mine! I had made my nest on a rock
in the mighty roadstead of Toulon, in a lowly villa
surrounded with aloe and cypress, with the prickly
pear and the wild rose. Before me was a spreading
basin of sparkling sea; behind me the bare-topt amphitheatre,
where, at their ease, might sit the Parliament
of the world.</p>

<p>This spot, so very African, bedazzles you in the
daytime with flashings as of steel. But of a winter
morning, especially in December, it seemed full of a
divine mystery. I was wont to rise exactly at six
o&#8217;clock, when the signal for work was boomed from
the Arsenal gun. From six to seven I enjoyed a
delicious time of it. The quick&mdash;may I call it piercing?&mdash;twinkle
of the stars made the moon ashamed,
and fought against the daybreak. Before its coming,
and during the struggle between two lights, the
wonderful clearness of the air would let things be
seen and heard at incredible distances. Two leagues
away I could make everything out. The smallest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
detail about the distant mountains, a tree, a cliff, a
house, a bend in the ground, was thrown out with
the most delicate sharpness. New senses seemed to
be given me. I found myself another being, released
from bondage, free to soar away on my new wings.
It was an hour of utter purity, all hard and clear.
I said to myself, &#8220;How is this? Am I still a
man?&#8221;</p>

<p>An unspeakable bluish hue, respected, left untouched
by the rosy dawn, hung round me like a sacred
ether, a spirit that made all things spiritual.</p>

<p>One felt, however, a forward movement, through
changes soft and slow. The great marvel was drawing
nearer, to shine forth and eclipse all other things. It
came on in its own calm way: you felt no wish to
hurry it. The coming transfiguration, the expected
witcheries of the light, took not a whit away from the
deep enjoyment of being still under the divinity of
night, still, as it were, half-hidden, and slow to emerge
from so wonderful a spell.... Come forth, O Sun!
We worship thee while yet unseen, but will reap all
of good we yet may from these last moments of our
dream!</p>

<p>He is about to break forth. In hope let us await
his welcome.</p>
